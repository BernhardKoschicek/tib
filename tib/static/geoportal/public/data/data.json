    "description": "Sava Mrkalj (1783-1833) was a Serbian philologist, poet, teacher and monk. He was born in Sjeničak (Military Frontier, today Croatia) in 1783 and educated in Plaški and Zagreb. After that he studied Philosophy and Mathematics in Pest from 1807 to 1810, where he met Dimitrije Davidović (1789-1838) and Dimitrije Frušić (1790-1838). His first meeting with Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (1787-1864) was also in Pest in 1810. This year was the most important in Mrkalj's life, because he published his main work entitled \"Сало дебелога јера либо азбукопротрес\". In this short work (only 18 pages) he presented his ideas on the reform of the Serbian language. Sava Mrkalj, a remarkable polyglot, was already familiar with the works of John Lock (1632-1704) and especially of Johann Christoph Adelung (1732-1806). Mrkalj's credo was \"Write as you speak and read, as it is written\". Vuk Stefanović Karadžić created his reform of the Serbian orthography having Mrkalj's work as a model. Sava Mrkalj became a monk in 1811. Later he lived as a teacher with many difficulties. He fell ill and after a few years in Karlovac (today Croatia) he was sent to the psychiatry in Vienna (\"Narrenturm\") in 1829. In his last days he was visited by Vuk Stefanović Karadćić who brought him books. Sava Mrkalj died in the aforesaid psychiatry on 24 August 1833. His place of burial is unknown. In the year 2016 a commemorative plaque was put on the front of the Serbian Orthodox Church of Saint Sava (Veithgasse 3, 1030 Vienna) on the initiative of two scholars from the field of Slavonic Studies, Gordana Ilić-Marković and Dušan Ivanić.",

Laza Kostić was an associate of Svetozar Miletić (1826-1901), the political leader of the Serbs in the region of Vojvodina. Laza Kostić was a deputy in the Hungarian Parliament and also at the Serbian Church-People's Assembly in Sremski Karlovci (today Serbia). During his visits to Vienna in the 1880s he stayed at the home of his friend Jovan Jovanović Zmaj (1833-1904). As Jovan Jovanović wrote in his diary, they were often together at the restaurant \"Griechenbeisl\" (Fleischmarkt 11, 1010 Vienna). Laza Kostić died in the Cottagesanatorium (Sternwartestraße 74, 1180 Vienna) on 9 December 1910. He stayed there from the beginning of November 1910, and his last days were described by Dr. Milan Šević. On this very building the Matica Srpska placed a commemorative plaque in 1960.",

    "description": "Prince Mihailo Obrenović (1823-1868) was born on 16 September 1823 in Kragujevac (today Serbia). He was Prince of Serbia from 1838 to 1842, and after his exile from 1860 to his assassination on 10 June 1868 in Belgrade. His second rule was characterised by the liberation of Serbian cities from Ottoman garrisons, which was a great diplomatic effort and success. It was also his idea to create a Balkan Federation against the Ottoman Empire. Mihailo Obrenović was an enlightened ruler who travelled through Europe during his period of exile (1844-1850). He wanted to incorporate many of the Western European achievements into Serbian society. Mihailo Obrenović died childless in 1868. He was succeeded by his cousin, Milan Obrenović (1854-1901), whose grandfather was Jevrem Obrenović (1790-1856), a brother of Prince Miloš Obrenović (1780-1860) and Prince Mihailo's uncle.  \nPrince Mihailo Obrenović lived in Vienna with some interruptions between 1843 and 1860. He was the friend and supporter of many Serbian poets and writers in Vienna, starting with Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (1787-1864), on whose recommendation the Prince travelled through the German states and met Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886) and Jacob Grimm (1785-1863), then Anastas Jovanović (1817-1899), Djura Daničić (1825-1882), Branko Radičević (1824-1853), etc. In July 1853 Djura Daničić returned to Vienna on the Prince's invitation to be a teacher of the Serbian language for the Princess Julie Obrenović (1831-1919). \nPrince Mihailo Obrenović was also best man and godfather of the family of Major General Djordje Stratimirović (1822-1908) in Vienna. On 10 May 1854 the Prince was best man at the wedding of Djordje Stratimirović in the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity, and then he and later the Prince and King Milan Obrenović were godfathers of the Stratimirović children. There are also several compositions of famous Austrian composers, which were dedicated to Prince Mihailo Obrenović: Johann Strauss Son op. 14 \"Serben Quadrille\" from 1846; Phillip Fahrbach Senior op. 151 \"Serben Polka\" from 1853  and Johann Dubez Op. 17 \"Divertissement sur des motifs de l'Opéra: Ernani pour la Zither\". He married Countess Julie Hunyady de Kéthely (1831-1919) in the Russian Orthodox chapel of the Russian Legation in Vienna on 1 August 1853. His best man was the Russian diplomat Peter von Meyendorff (1796-1863). The Austrian newspapers wrote that the Prince was dressed in national costume and had a sabre with diamonds worth 80,000 florins. On the other side the Princess wore a diamond diadem. They lived in the \"Obrenovic-Palais\" in Vienna and the Castle of \"Ivanka\" near Bratislava (Ivanka pri Dunaji, today Slovakia). They separated by a signed agreement on 18 November 1865. The house in Vienna (estimated to be worth 100,000 ducats) and also the Castle of \"Ivanka\" became a property of the Princess and she received a yearly allocation of 5,500 ducats.",

She was born in Landstraße 291 (today 66, 1030 Vienna) on 12 July 1828 and was baptised in the Roman Catholic Church of St. Rochus (Landstraßer Hauptstraße 54-56, 1030 Vienna). Her godfather was Theodor Demeter Tirka (1764-1839), a Greek merchant and banker from Vienna, her father’s benefactor and private banker of the Obrenović Dynasty. \nMina was a secretary to her father and accompanied him on his journeys. She was very active in Vienna's social events and is described as a very educated and beautiful girl, who maintained contacts with numerous writers and artists. She spoke with her mother in German and with her father in Serbian. In addition to her bilingualism, she also learned Italian, French and English. She played piano and painted (over 50 paintings are preserved). In addition to the translation of Vuk's poems into German, which Jacob Grimm (1785-1863) praised, Mina also worked on the translation of the work of the publisher Ludwig August Frankl Ritter von Hochwart (1810-1894) entitled \"Gusle, der Freund des Hauses\" (Vienna 1852). Mina wrote to her brother Dimitrije in 1848 that she goes to Belvedere park and paints there five to six hours a day and three times a week. In 1858 she married Professor Aleksa Vukomanović (1826-1859) from Belgrade and converted to Orthodoxy. After his death in 1859 she moved to Vienna with their son Janko. In Vienna Mina looked after her parents. Vuk died in 1864 and Anna on 11 August 1876 in Beatrixgasse 16a (1030 Vienna). Mina died in the same house on 12 June 1894.",

After attending grammar school in Sremski Karlovci (today Serbia), he studied first Law in Vienna from 1843 and then Medicine. He received financial support from Prince Mihailo Obrenović (1823-1868) during his studies. Therefore, the second volume of his poems was dedicated to Prince Mihailo Obrenović, while the first one was devoted to the Serbian youth. Branko Radičević published his first two volumes of poems in the publishing house of the Mekhitarist Congregation in Vienna (\"Pesme I\" in 1847 and \"Pesme II\" in 1851). The third volume of his poems was published by his father posthumously in 1862. Branko Radičević's best friend was Djura Daničić (1825-1882).

Branko Radičević was seriously ill from tuberculosis and died on 1 July 1853 in Schlösselgasse 12 (1080 Vienna). He was buried in the Orthodox part of the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna).

After studying History of Art and German Philology at the University of Vienna, he wrote his first works between 1912 and 1918 (e.g. \"Die Gewalten\", \"Die Sünde wider den Geist’\", \"Die rote Straße\" etc). From 1922 to 1928 he was a dramatic advisor at the Raimundtheater and the Volkstheater in Vienna, and later he became President of the Austrian PEN Club. From 1968 he was Vice-President of International PEN Club. Csokor received amongst others the Literarurpreis der Stadt Wien in 1927, the Burgtheaterring in 1938, the Grillparzer Preis in 1938 and the Großer Österreichischer Staatspreis in 1955. Since 1933 he had risen his voice against the persecution of writers in Germany, which led to a ban of his books there. It is interesting that Csokor, who was a great humanist and enemy of National Socialism, was in exile since 1938 and that he lived in Yugoslavia, the country of his ancestors, from 1941 to 1944. He described this period in his autobiographic work \"Als Zivilist im Balkankrieg\" (Vienna 1947). However, his most popular work was \"3 November 1918\", which was staged in the Burgtheater in Vienna. Franz Theodor Maria Csokor died on 5 January 1969 in the Franz Josefs Spital in Vienna and was buried in the Viennese Central Cemetery (Wiener Zentralfriedhof, 1110 Vienna).",

After attending the grammar school in Bratislava, he came to Vienna in order to study Law in 1845. He had already been a supporter of Vuk Karadžić's ideas, and in Vienna he became one of Vuk's most important associates. In Vuk's house he became acquainted with the Bishop Petar II Petrović Njegoš of Montenegro, Ljuba Nenadović, Danilo Medaković, Prince Mihailo Obrenović, Prince Miloš Obrenović, Anastas Jovanović and many others. His best friend in Vienna was the Serbian poet Branko Radičević. Already in 1846 he gave up his studies in Law and turned to Philology. His professor was Franz von Miklosich. Djura Daničić spoke Latin, German, Hungarian, Polish, Czech, Slovak and Russian, before he moved to Vienna. As Vuk's most dedicated follower he printed brochures, in which he supported Vuk's ideas. His most important text was \"The War for the Serbian Language and Orthography\" (\"Рат за Српски језик и правопис\") printed in Pest in 1847. He signed this publication as Djura Daničić.

For three years Djura Daničić was the teacher of the Princess, and she became his benefactor, financially supporting the printing of his books. In 1860 he translated the Old Testament into Serbian. It is interesting to mention that he taught Serbian also to Princess Natalija Obrenović in Paris in 1876.

The Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1848-1916) permitted, at the request of the Serbian Patriarch in Sremski Karlovci Josif Rajačić (1785-1861), the constitution of the parish and the collection of donations. The constitutional meeting took place in November 1860. At this time, about 500 Serbs were living permanently and about 1,000 temporarily in Vienna. The Serbian parish received free of charge a site on the Franz-Josefs-Kai (1010 Vienna) for the erection of a new church, but the building could not start due to the lack of funds until the year 1890, which meant that a new site had to be looked for, since the old one had been already used in the meantime.\nUntil the year 1886 an amount of 80,000 florins (Gulden) had been collected. 80% were donated by Serbs, while 20% were given to the parish by other inhabitants of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose donations are recorded in the \"Golden Book of the Serbian Orthodox parish in Vienna, Names of donors and benefactors\" (Златна књига српске православне црквено-школске опћине у Бечу, Имена прилагача и добротвора). The total sum recorded in the Golden Book amounts to 25,210 florins (Gulden) and enabled the Serbian Orthodox parish to acquire a site in Veithgasse 3 (1030 Vienna) for 27,000 florins (Gulden) in 1889. The erection of the church began in 1890 under the supervision of the architect Heinrich Wagner, who himself donated 200 florins (Gulden). The erection of the building was completed in 1893 at an expense of 58,000 florins (Gulden), and the church has the capacity to hold 400 believers. \nAfter the constitution of the Serbian Orthodox parish, there existed along with the two Greek Orthodox parishes of Saint George and the Holy Trinity all together three Orthodox parishes in Vienna, and that is why it was necessary to determine a new domain of jurisdiction. After an agreement between the three parishes, the governorship of Lower Austria (Erzherzogtum Österreich unter der Enns) decided on 1 May 1893 that the new Serbian Orthodox parish had jurisdiction over all Orthodox people of Slavic nationality. \nOn 19 November 1893 the church was consecrated to Saint Sava, the patron saint of all Serbs, in the presence of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I, an event that was reported in several Viennese newspapers. It marked the beginning of a very fruitful period of Serbian religious and cultural life in the Austro-Hungarian capital that lasted until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.\nThe first priest of the parish was Mihajlo Mišić (1864-1924) from 1896 to 1924. He was followed by Bogdan Popović (1925-1927), Dr. Rodoljub Stojaković (1927-1935) and by Dr. Miloje Aranicki (1935-1941).\nIn 1904 the Serbian Ladies' Benevolent Society in Vienna (\"Serbischer Frauen Wohltätigkeitsverein\"). was founded and had its office in the building of the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava (Veithgasse 3, 1030 Vienna). Its founder and president was Jelena Ostojić (1874-1967), the daughter of Aleksandar Ostojić (1839-1917).",

The Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1848-1916) permitted, at the request of the Serbian Patriarch in Sremski Karlovci Josif Rajačić (1785-1861), the constitution of the parish and the collection of donations. The constitutional meeting took place in November 1860. At this time, about 500 Serbs were living permanently and about 1,000 temporarily in Vienna. The Serbian parish received free of charge a site on the Franz-Josefs-Kai (1010 Vienna) for the erection of a new church, but the building could not start due to the lack of funds until the year 1890, which meant that a new site had to be looked for, since the old one had been already used in the meantime.\nUntil the year 1886 an amount of 80,000 florins (Gulden) had been collected. 80% were donated by Serbs, while 20% were given to the parish by other inhabitants of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose donations are recorded in the \"Golden Book of the Serbian Orthodox parish in Vienna, Names of donors and benefactors\" (Златна књига српске православне црквено-школске опћине у Бечу, Имена прилагача и добротвора). The total sum recorded in the Golden Book amounts to 25,210 florins (Gulden) and enabled the Serbian Orthodox parish to acquire a site in Veithgasse 3 (1030 Vienna) for 27,000 florins (Gulden) in 1889. The erection of the church began in 1890 under the supervision of the architect Heinrich Wagner, who himself donated 200 florins (Gulden). The erection of the building was completed in 1893 at an expense of 58,000 florins (Gulden), and the church has the capacity to hold 400 believers. \nAfter the constitution of the Serbian Orthodox parish, there existed along with the two Greek Orthodox parishes of Saint George and the Holy Trinity all together three Orthodox parishes in Vienna, and that is why it was necessary to determine a new domain of jurisdiction. After an agreement between the three parishes, the governorship of Lower Austria (Erzherzogtum Österreich unter der Enns) decided on 1 May 1893 that the new Serbian Orthodox parish had jurisdiction over all Orthodox people of Slavic nationality. \nOn 19 November 1893 the church was consecrated to Saint Sava, the patron saint of all Serbs, in the presence of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I, an event that was reported in several Viennese newspapers. It marked the beginning of a very fruitful period of Serbian religious and cultural life in the Austro-Hungarian capital that lasted until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.\nThe first priest of the parish was Mihajlo Mišić (1864-1924) from 1896 to 1924. He was followed by Bogdan Popović (1925-1927), Dr. Rodoljub Stojaković (1927-1935) and by Dr. Miloje Aranicki (1935-1941).\nIn 1904 the Serbian Ladies' Benevolent Society in Vienna (\"Serbischer Frauen Wohltätigkeitsverein\"). was founded and had its office in the building of the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava (Veithgasse 3, 1030 Vienna). Its founder and president was Jelena Ostojić (1874-1967), the daughter of Aleksandar Ostojić (1839-1917).",

The total sum recorded in the Golden Book amounts to 25,210 florins (Gulden) and enabled the Serbian Orthodox parish to acquire a site in Veithgasse 3 (1030 Vienna) for 27,000 florins (Gulden) in 1889.

        "location_description": "Around the middle of the 19th century the Viennese Serbs set about founding their church parish of Saint Sava under the leadership of Privy Councillor Dr. Georgije Stojaković (1811-1863). The Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1848-1916) permitted, at the request of the Serbian Patriarch in Sremski Karlovci Josif Rajačić (1785-1861), the constitution of the parish and the collection of donations. The constitutional meeting took place in November 1860. At this time, about 500 Serbs were living permanently and about 1,000 temporarily in Vienna. The Serbian parish received free of charge a site on the Franz-Josefs-Kai (1010 Vienna) for the erection of a new church, but the building could not start due to the lack of funds until the year 1890, which meant that a new site had to be looked for, since the old one had been already used in the meantime.\nUntil the year 1886 an amount of 80,000 florins (Gulden) had been collected. 80% were donated by Serbs, while 20% were given to the parish by other inhabitants of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose donations are recorded in the \"Golden Book of the Serbian Orthodox parish in Vienna, Names of donors and benefactors\" (Златна књига српске православне црквено-школске опћине у Бечу, Имена прилагача и добротвора). The total sum recorded in the Golden Book amounts to 25,210 florins (Gulden) and enabled the Serbian Orthodox parish to acquire a site in Veithgasse 3 (1030 Vienna) for 27,000 florins (Gulden) in 1889. The erection of the church began in 1890 under the supervision of the architect Heinrich Wagner, who himself donated 200 florins (Gulden). The erection of the building was completed in 1893 at an expense of 58,000 florins (Gulden), and the church has the capacity to hold 400 believers. \nAfter the constitution of the Serbian Orthodox parish, there existed along with the two Greek Orthodox parishes of Saint George and the Holy Trinity all together three Orthodox parishes in Vienna, and that is why it was necessary to determine a new domain of jurisdiction. After an agreement between the three parishes, the governorship of Lower Austria (Erzherzogtum Österreich unter der Enns) decided on 1 May 1893 that the new Serbian Orthodox parish had jurisdiction over all Orthodox people of Slavic nationality. \nOn 19 November 1893 the church was consecrated to Saint Sava, the patron saint of all Serbs, in the presence of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I, an event that was reported in several Viennese newspapers. It marked the beginning of a very fruitful period of Serbian religious and cultural life in the Austro-Hungarian capital that lasted until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.\nThe first priest of the parish was Mihajlo Mišić (1864-1924) from 1896 to 1924. He was followed by Bogdan Popović (1925-1927), Dr. Rodoljub Stojaković (1927-1935) and by Dr. Miloje Aranicki (1935-1941).\nIn 1904 the Serbian Ladies' Benevolent Society in Vienna (\"Serbischer Frauen Wohltätigkeitsverein\"). was founded and had its office in the building of the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava (Veithgasse 3, 1030 Vienna). Its founder and president was Jelena Ostojić (1874-1967), the daughter of Aleksandar Ostojić (1839-1917).",

The Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1848-1916) permitted, at the request of the Serbian Patriarch in Sremski Karlovci Josif Rajačić (1785-1861), the constitution of the parish and the collection of donations. The constitutional meeting took place in November 1860. At this time, about 500 Serbs were living permanently and about 1,000 temporarily in Vienna. The Serbian parish received free of charge a site on the Franz-Josefs-Kai (1010 Vienna) for the erection of a new church, but the building could not start due to the lack of funds until the year 1890, which meant that a new site had to be looked for, since the old one had been already used in the meantime.\nUntil the year 1886 an amount of 80,000 florins (Gulden) had been collected. 80% were donated by Serbs, while 20% were given to the parish by other inhabitants of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose donations are recorded in the \"Golden Book of the Serbian Orthodox parish in Vienna, Names of donors and benefactors\" (Златна књига српске православне црквено-школске опћине у Бечу, Имена прилагача и добротвора). The total sum recorded in the Golden Book amounts to 25,210 florins (Gulden) and enabled the Serbian Orthodox parish to acquire a site in Veithgasse 3 (1030 Vienna) for 27,000 florins (Gulden) in 1889. The erection of the church began in 1890 under the supervision of the architect Heinrich Wagner, who himself donated 200 florins (Gulden). The erection of the building was completed in 1893 at an expense of 58,000 florins (Gulden), and the church has the capacity to hold 400 believers. \nAfter the constitution of the Serbian Orthodox parish, there existed along with the two Greek Orthodox parishes of Saint George and the Holy Trinity all together three Orthodox parishes in Vienna, and that is why it was necessary to determine a new domain of jurisdiction. After an agreement between the three parishes, the governorship of Lower Austria (Erzherzogtum Österreich unter der Enns) decided on 1 May 1893 that the new Serbian Orthodox parish had jurisdiction over all Orthodox people of Slavic nationality. \nOn 19 November 1893 the church was consecrated to Saint Sava, the patron saint of all Serbs, in the presence of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I, an event that was reported in several Viennese newspapers. It marked the beginning of a very fruitful period of Serbian religious and cultural life in the Austro-Hungarian capital that lasted until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.\nThe first priest of the parish was Mihajlo Mišić (1864-1924) from 1896 to 1924. He was followed by Bogdan Popović (1925-1927), Dr. Rodoljub Stojaković (1927-1935) and by Dr. Miloje Aranicki (1935-1941).\nIn 1904 the Serbian Ladies' Benevolent Society in Vienna (\"Serbischer Frauen Wohltätigkeitsverein\"). was founded and had its office in the building of the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava (Veithgasse 3, 1030 Vienna). Its founder and president was Jelena Ostojić (1874-1967), the daughter of Aleksandar Ostojić (1839-1917).",

The Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1848-1916) permitted, at the request of the Serbian Patriarch in Sremski Karlovci Josif Rajačić (1785-1861), the constitution of the parish and the collection of donations. The constitutional meeting took place in November 1860. At this time, about 500 Serbs were living permanently and about 1,000 temporarily in Vienna. The Serbian parish received free of charge a site on the Franz-Josefs-Kai (1010 Vienna) for the erection of a new church, but the building could not start due to the lack of funds until the year 1890, which meant that a new site had to be looked for, since the old one had been already used in the meantime.\nUntil the year 1886 an amount of 80,000 florins (Gulden) had been collected. 80% were donated by Serbs, while 20% were given to the parish by other inhabitants of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose donations are recorded in the \"Golden Book of the Serbian Orthodox parish in Vienna, Names of donors and benefactors\" (Златна књига српске православне црквено-школске опћине у Бечу, Имена прилагача и добротвора). The total sum recorded in the Golden Book amounts to 25,210 florins (Gulden) and enabled the Serbian Orthodox parish to acquire a site in Veithgasse 3 (1030 Vienna) for 27,000 florins (Gulden) in 1889. The erection of the church began in 1890 under the supervision of the architect Heinrich Wagner, who himself donated 200 florins (Gulden). The erection of the building was completed in 1893 at an expense of 58,000 florins (Gulden), and the church has the capacity to hold 400 believers. \nAfter the constitution of the Serbian Orthodox parish, there existed along with the two Greek Orthodox parishes of Saint George and the Holy Trinity all together three Orthodox parishes in Vienna, and that is why it was necessary to determine a new domain of jurisdiction.

The constitutional meeting took place in November 1860. At this time, about 500 Serbs were living permanently and about 1,000 temporarily in Vienna. The Serbian parish received free of charge a site on the Franz-Josefs-Kai (1010 Vienna) for the erection of a new church, but the building could not start due to the lack of funds until the year 1890, which meant that a new site had to be looked for, since the old one had been already used in the meantime.\nUntil the year 1886 an amount of 80,000 florins (Gulden) had been collected. 80% were donated by Serbs, while 20% were given to the parish by other inhabitants of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose donations are recorded in the \"Golden Book of the Serbian Orthodox parish in Vienna, Names of donors and benefactors\" (Златна књига српске православне црквено-школске опћине у Бечу, Имена прилагача и добротвора). The total sum recorded in the Golden Book amounts to 25,210 florins (Gulden) and enabled the Serbian Orthodox parish to acquire a site in Veithgasse 3 (1030 Vienna) for 27,000 florins (Gulden) in 1889. The erection of the church began in 1890 under the supervision of the architect Heinrich Wagner, who himself donated 200 florins (Gulden). The erection of the building was completed in 1893 at an expense of 58,000 florins (Gulden), and the church has the capacity to hold 400 believers. \nAfter the constitution of the Serbian Orthodox parish, there existed along with the two Greek Orthodox parishes of Saint George and the Holy Trinity all together three Orthodox parishes in Vienna, and that is why it was necessary to determine a new domain of jurisdiction. After an agreement between the three parishes, the governorship of Lower Austria (Erzherzogtum Österreich unter der Enns) decided on 1 May 1893 that the new Serbian Orthodox parish had jurisdiction over all Orthodox people of Slavic nationality. \nOn 19 November 1893 the church was consecrated to Saint Sava, the patron saint of all Serbs, in the presence of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I, an event that was reported in several Viennese newspapers. It marked the beginning of a very fruitful period of Serbian religious and cultural life in the Austro-Hungarian capital that lasted until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.\nThe first priest of the parish was Mihajlo Mišić (1864-1924) from 1896 to 1924. He was followed by Bogdan Popović (1925-1927), Dr. Rodoljub Stojaković (1927-1935) and by Dr. Miloje Aranicki (1935-1941).\nIn 1904 the Serbian Ladies' Benevolent Society in Vienna (\"Serbischer Frauen Wohltätigkeitsverein\"). was founded and had its office in the building of the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava (Veithgasse 3, 1030 Vienna). Its founder and president was Jelena Ostojić (1874-1967), the daughter of Aleksandar Ostojić (1839-1917).",

Thanks to the intervention of Bishop Nikodim Milaš (1845-1915) of Dalmatia he was finally officially appointed in 1896. Until the outbreak of the First World War (1914) Mihajlo Mišić was an integral part of the vivid religious and cultural life of the Serbian Orthodox Community. During the years of hardship in the war itself he was indefatigably supporting and helping his flock as well as Serbian prisoners of war in Austria-Hungary.

        "location_description": "Around the middle of the 19th century the Viennese Serbs set about founding their church parish of Saint Sava under the leadership of Privy Councillor Dr. Georgije Stojaković (1811-1863). The Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1848-1916) permitted, at the request of the Serbian Patriarch in Sremski Karlovci Josif Rajačić (1785-1861), the constitution of the parish and the collection of donations. The constitutional meeting took place in November 1860. At this time, about 500 Serbs were living permanently and about 1,000 temporarily in Vienna. The Serbian parish received free of charge a site on the Franz-Josefs-Kai (1010 Vienna) for the erection of a new church, but the building could not start due to the lack of funds until the year 1890, which meant that a new site had to be looked for, since the old one had been already used in the meantime.\nUntil the year 1886 an amount of 80,000 florins (Gulden) had been collected. 80% were donated by Serbs, while 20% were given to the parish by other inhabitants of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose donations are recorded in the \"Golden Book of the Serbian Orthodox parish in Vienna, Names of donors and benefactors\" (Златна књига српске православне црквено-школске опћине у Бечу, Имена прилагача и добротвора). The total sum recorded in the Golden Book amounts to 25,210 florins (Gulden) and enabled the Serbian Orthodox parish to acquire a site in Veithgasse 3 (1030 Vienna) for 27,000 florins (Gulden) in 1889. The erection of the church began in 1890 under the supervision of the architect Heinrich Wagner, who himself donated 200 florins (Gulden). The erection of the building was completed in 1893 at an expense of 58,000 florins (Gulden), and the church has the capacity to hold 400 believers. \nAfter the constitution of the Serbian Orthodox parish, there existed along with the two Greek Orthodox parishes of Saint George and the Holy Trinity all together three Orthodox parishes in Vienna, and that is why it was necessary to determine a new domain of jurisdiction. After an agreement between the three parishes, the governorship of Lower Austria (Erzherzogtum Österreich unter der Enns) decided on 1 May 1893 that the new Serbian Orthodox parish had jurisdiction over all Orthodox people of Slavic nationality. \nOn 19 November 1893 the church was consecrated to Saint Sava, the patron saint of all Serbs, in the presence of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I, an event that was reported in several Viennese newspapers. It marked the beginning of a very fruitful period of Serbian religious and cultural life in the Austro-Hungarian capital that lasted until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.\nThe first priest of the parish was Mihajlo Mišić (1864-1924) from 1896 to 1924. He was followed by Bogdan Popović (1925-1927), Dr. Rodoljub Stojaković (1927-1935) and by Dr. Miloje Aranicki (1935-1941).\nIn 1904 the Serbian Ladies' Benevolent Society in Vienna (\"Serbischer Frauen Wohltätigkeitsverein\"). was founded and had its office in the building of the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava (Veithgasse 3, 1030 Vienna). Its founder and president was Jelena Ostojić (1874-1967), the daughter of Aleksandar Ostojić (1839-1917).",

He succeeded his cousin Prince Mihailo Obrenović (1823-1868) in 1868. During his rule Serbia became an independent state after two Serbian-Ottoman Wars (1876-1878) and was internationally recognised by the Treaty of Berlin (1878). His reign was also a period of modernisation. Milan Obrenović abdicated in 1889, and his 13 year old son Aleksandar Obrenović (1876-1903) became King. After the abdication Milan Obrenović lived in Paris and in 1897 returned to Serbia, where he was installed as the commander-in-chief of the Serbian army. After a disagreement regarding his son's wedding with Draga Mašin (1864-1903) he left Serbia. Milan Obrenović settled in Vienna. From autumn 1900 he lived firstly in the Hotel Imperial and then in an apartment in Johannesgasse 16 (1010 Vienna). Here died Milan Obrenović on 11 February 1901. He was a close friend of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916), who awarded to him the Grand Cross of the Austrian Imperial Order of Leopold (\"Großkreuz des Leopoldordens\") on 7 January 1870. The 97th Infantry Regiment of the Austro-Hungarian Army (Küstenländisch-krainerisches Infanterieregiment Nr. 97) was named after him in 1883 (until 1892).

        "location_description": "Around the middle of the 19th century the Viennese Serbs set about founding their church parish of Saint Sava under the leadership of Privy Councillor Dr. Georgije Stojaković (1811-1863). The Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1848-1916) permitted, at the request of the Serbian Patriarch in Sremski Karlovci Josif Rajačić (1785-1861), the constitution of the parish and the collection of donations. The constitutional meeting took place in November 1860. At this time, about 500 Serbs were living permanently and about 1,000 temporarily in Vienna. The Serbian parish received free of charge a site on the Franz-Josefs-Kai (1010 Vienna) for the erection of a new church, but the building could not start due to the lack of funds until the year 1890, which meant that a new site had to be looked for, since the old one had been already used in the meantime.\nUntil the year 1886 an amount of 80,000 florins (Gulden) had been collected. 80% were donated by Serbs, while 20% were given to the parish by other inhabitants of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose donations are recorded in the \"Golden Book of the Serbian Orthodox parish in Vienna, Names of donors and benefactors\" (Златна књига српске православне црквено-школске опћине у Бечу, Имена прилагача и добротвора). The total sum recorded in the Golden Book amounts to 25,210 florins (Gulden) and enabled the Serbian Orthodox parish to acquire a site in Veithgasse 3 (1030 Vienna) for 27,000 florins (Gulden) in 1889. The erection of the church began in 1890 under the supervision of the architect Heinrich Wagner, who himself donated 200 florins (Gulden). The erection of the building was completed in 1893 at an expense of 58,000 florins (Gulden), and the church has the capacity to hold 400 believers. \nAfter the constitution of the Serbian Orthodox parish, there existed along with the two Greek Orthodox parishes of Saint George and the Holy Trinity all together three Orthodox parishes in Vienna, and that is why it was necessary to determine a new domain of jurisdiction. After an agreement between the three parishes, the governorship of Lower Austria (Erzherzogtum Österreich unter der Enns) decided on 1 May 1893 that the new Serbian Orthodox parish had jurisdiction over all Orthodox people of Slavic nationality. \nOn 19 November 1893 the church was consecrated to Saint Sava, the patron saint of all Serbs, in the presence of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I, an event that was reported in several Viennese newspapers.

He was a close friend of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916), who awarded to him the Grand Cross of the Austrian Imperial Order of Leopold (\"Großkreuz des Leopoldordens\") on 7 January 1870. The 97th Infantry Regiment of the Austro-Hungarian Army (Küstenländisch-krainerisches Infanterieregiment Nr. 97) was named after him in 1883 (until 1892). There are several compositions of Austrian composers, which were dedicated to King Milan Obrenović: two compositions to King Milan and Queen Natalija by Philipp Fahrbach Junior (1884), the \"King Milan March\" by Anton Riedl (1885) and three songs by Carl Streitmann (1887).",

It is not clear what happened with King Milan's legacy. After his death all objects from the apartment were transferred to Belgrade, but after the overthrow of the Obrenović Dynasty in 1903 its destiny is unknown. One of the possible answers could be the two auctions in the Viennese auction house \"Dorotheum\" from 1905 and 1906. On the first auction (10-16 October 1905) Queen Natalija Obrenović (1859-1941), Milan's former wife, sold objects of the Kings Milan and Aleksandar. It was a collection of 1166 objects (silverware, porcelain, ivory, bronze, vases, statues, lamps, paintings and furniture from the Royal Palace in Belgrade). The second auction took place on 30 October 1906. Here were offered 126 objects, among them 110 paintings.",

The Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1848-1916) permitted, at the request of the Serbian Patriarch in Sremski Karlovci Josif Rajačić (1785-1861), the constitution of the parish and the collection of donations. The constitutional meeting took place in November 1860. At this time, about 500 Serbs were living permanently and about 1,000 temporarily in Vienna. The Serbian parish received free of charge a site on the Franz-Josefs-Kai (1010 Vienna) for the erection of a new church, but the building could not start due to the lack of funds until the year 1890, which meant that a new site had to be looked for, since the old one had been already used in the meantime.\nUntil the year 1886 an amount of 80,000 florins (Gulden) had been collected. 80% were donated by Serbs, while 20% were given to the parish by other inhabitants of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose donations are recorded in the \"Golden Book of the Serbian Orthodox parish in Vienna, Names of donors and benefactors\" (Златна књига српске православне црквено-школске опћине у Бечу, Имена прилагача и добротвора). The total sum recorded in the Golden Book amounts to 25,210 florins (Gulden) and enabled the Serbian Orthodox parish to acquire a site in Veithgasse 3 (1030 Vienna) for 27,000 florins (Gulden) in 1889. The erection of the church began in 1890 under the supervision of the architect Heinrich Wagner, who himself donated 200 florins (Gulden). The erection of the building was completed in 1893 at an expense of 58,000 florins (Gulden), and the church has the capacity to hold 400 believers. \nAfter the constitution of the Serbian Orthodox parish, there existed along with the two Greek Orthodox parishes of Saint George and the Holy Trinity all together three Orthodox parishes in Vienna, and that is why it was necessary to determine a new domain of jurisdiction. After an agreement between the three parishes, the governorship of Lower Austria (Erzherzogtum Österreich unter der Enns) decided on 1 May 1893 that the new Serbian Orthodox parish had jurisdiction over all Orthodox people of Slavic nationality. \nOn 19 November 1893 the church was consecrated to Saint Sava, the patron saint of all Serbs, in the presence of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I, an event that was reported in several Viennese newspapers. It marked the beginning of a very fruitful period of Serbian religious and cultural life in the Austro-Hungarian capital that lasted until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.\nThe first priest of the parish was Mihajlo Mišić (1864-1924) from 1896 to 1924.

The Serbian parish received free of charge a site on the Franz-Josefs-Kai (1010 Vienna) for the erection of a new church, but the building could not start due to the lack of funds until the year 1890, which meant that a new site had to be looked for, since the old one had been already used in the meantime.\nUntil the year 1886 an amount of 80,000 florins (Gulden) had been collected. 80% were donated by Serbs, while 20% were given to the parish by other inhabitants of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose donations are recorded in the \"Golden Book of the Serbian Orthodox parish in Vienna, Names of donors and benefactors\" (Златна књига српске православне црквено-школске опћине у Бечу, Имена прилагача и добротвора). The total sum recorded in the Golden Book amounts to 25,210 florins (Gulden) and enabled the Serbian Orthodox parish to acquire a site in Veithgasse 3 (1030 Vienna) for 27,000 florins (Gulden) in 1889. The erection of the church began in 1890 under the supervision of the architect Heinrich Wagner, who himself donated 200 florins (Gulden). The erection of the building was completed in 1893 at an expense of 58,000 florins (Gulden), and the church has the capacity to hold 400 believers. \nAfter the constitution of the Serbian Orthodox parish, there existed along with the two Greek Orthodox parishes of Saint George and the Holy Trinity all together three Orthodox parishes in Vienna, and that is why it was necessary to determine a new domain of jurisdiction. After an agreement between the three parishes, the governorship of Lower Austria (Erzherzogtum Österreich unter der Enns) decided on 1 May 1893 that the new Serbian Orthodox parish had jurisdiction over all Orthodox people of Slavic nationality. \nOn 19 November 1893 the church was consecrated to Saint Sava, the patron saint of all Serbs, in the presence of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I, an event that was reported in several Viennese newspapers. It marked the beginning of a very fruitful period of Serbian religious and cultural life in the Austro-Hungarian capital that lasted until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.\nThe first priest of the parish was Mihajlo Mišić (1864-1924) from 1896 to 1924. He was followed by Bogdan Popović (1925-1927), Dr. Rodoljub Stojaković (1927-1935) and by Dr. Miloje Aranicki (1935-1941).\nIn 1904 the Serbian Ladies' Benevolent Society in Vienna (\"Serbischer Frauen Wohltätigkeitsverein\"). was founded and had its office in the building of the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava (Veithgasse 3, 1030 Vienna). Its founder and president was Jelena Ostojić (1874-1967), the daughter of Aleksandar Ostojić (1839-1917).",

He succeeded his cousin Prince Mihailo Obrenović (1823-1868) in 1868. During his rule Serbia became an independent state after two Serbian-Ottoman Wars (1876-1878) and was internationally recognised by the Treaty of Berlin (1878).

After the abdication Milan Obrenović lived in Paris and in 1897 returned to Serbia, where he was installed as the commander-in-chief of the Serbian army.

His painting \"Bashibozuk\" was sold at an auction at Sotheby's in London in April 2018 for £ 465,000. This was the most expensive painting of a Serbian painter to be sold worldwide. Pavle Jovanović studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna (\"Akademie der bildenden Künste\") from 1877 to 1884, where he received several awards and scholarships. In 1882 he was awarded the first prize in the Academy's annual exhibition and an imperial scholarship for the painting \"Wounded Montenegrin\". The public and many art critics turned their attention to the young painter, and in 1883 he signed a contract with a gallery in London. Jovanović then travelled through the Caucasus, Morocco, Egypt, Greece, Turkey, Italy and Spain. After spending time in Paris and Munich, Pavle Jovanović stayed in Vienna, where he had his studio at Mariahilferstraße 3 (1060 Vienna). In 1899 he received the Reichel Artist Award at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna for his work \"Furor Teutonicus\". For the World Fair in Paris in 1900 he painted a great historical composition \"The Proclamation of Dušan's Law\", for which he received the Golden Award. Since 1905 he almost exclusively painted portraits. He has portrayed almost all famous Serbian scientists, composers and members of the Karadjordjević dynasty. Pavle Jovanović has painted more than ten portraits of Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916). The Emperor's valet Eugen Ketterl describes in his memoirs that Pavle Jovanović was the best painter of the Emperor's portraits. Ketterl writes: \"Unter den Kaiserbildern ragen die von Jovanovic geschaffenen Ölgemälde durch künstlerische Vollendung und Ähnlichkeit hervor. (...) Da der Kaiser wenig Zeit zum Sitzen hatte, stellte der Künstler einmal ein Porträt in bloß zwei Stunden fertig. Es war für den Dampfer \"Franz Josef I.\" der Donau-Dampfschiffahrts-Gesellschaft bestimmt, der gelegentlich der Eröffnung der Donaufahrtrinne bei Orsova eingeweiht wurde. Der Dampfer hatte einen wundervollen Speisesaal, der durch verschiebbare Wände in zwei weitere Räume - Schlafzimmer und Arbeitskabinett des Kaisers - abgeteilt werden konnte. Das Gemälde gehört zu den besten, die vom Monarchen existieren. Es stellt ihn in Kampagneuniform (blauem Waffenrock) dar und ist so sprechend ähnlich und naturgetreu, daß man vermeint, den Kaiser aus dem Rahmen heraustreten zu sehen.\" (Eugen Ketterl, Der alte Kaiser wie nur Einer ihn sah. Der wahrheutsgetreue Bericht des Leibkammerdieners Kaiser Franz Josephs I. Mit 23 Abbildungen. Wien et al. 1980, p. 123) He spent the period between the two World Wars mostly in Belgrade and Vienna. At the end of the 1930s he returned to Belgrade, where he remained until 1946. Pavle Jovanović then moved back to Vienna, where he died in Laudongasse 67 (1080 Vienna) on 30 November 1957.",

After spending time in Paris and Munich, Pavle Jovanović stayed in Vienna, where he had his studio at Mariahilferstraße 3 (1060 Vienna). In 1899 he received the Reichel Artist Award at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna for his work \"Furor Teutonicus\". For the World Fair in Paris in 1900 he painted a great historical composition \"The Proclamation of Dušan's Law\", for which he received the Golden Award. Since 1905 he almost exclusively painted portraits. He has portrayed almost all famous Serbian scientists, composers and members of the Karadjordjević dynasty. Pavle Jovanović has painted more than ten portraits of Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916). The Emperor's valet Eugen Ketterl describes in his memoirs that Pavle Jovanović was the best painter of the Emperor's portraits. Ketterl writes: \"Unter den Kaiserbildern ragen die von Jovanovic geschaffenen Ölgemälde durch künstlerische Vollendung und Ähnlichkeit hervor. (...) Da der Kaiser wenig Zeit zum Sitzen hatte, stellte der Künstler einmal ein Porträt in bloß zwei Stunden fertig. Es war für den Dampfer \"Franz Josef I.\" der Donau-Dampfschiffahrts-Gesellschaft bestimmt, der gelegentlich der Eröffnung der Donaufahrtrinne bei Orsova eingeweiht wurde. Der Dampfer hatte einen wundervollen Speisesaal, der durch verschiebbare Wände in zwei weitere Räume - Schlafzimmer und Arbeitskabinett des Kaisers - abgeteilt werden konnte. Das Gemälde gehört zu den besten, die vom Monarchen existieren. Es stellt ihn in Kampagneuniform (blauem Waffenrock) dar und ist so sprechend ähnlich und naturgetreu, daß man vermeint, den Kaiser aus dem Rahmen heraustreten zu sehen.\" (Eugen Ketterl, Der alte Kaiser wie nur Einer ihn sah. Der wahrheutsgetreue Bericht des Leibkammerdieners Kaiser Franz Josephs I. Mit 23 Abbildungen. Wien et al. 1980, p. 123) He spent the period between the two World Wars mostly in Belgrade and Vienna. At the end of the 1930s he returned to Belgrade, where he remained until 1946. Pavle Jovanović then moved back to Vienna, where he died in Laudongasse 67 (1080 Vienna) on 30 November 1957.",

He was born in Gomirje near Ogulin of Serbian parents (Military Frontier, today Croatia) in 1795. After finishing the k.u.k. Technische Militärakademie in Vienna, he joined the Austrian Army in 1815. In January 1851 he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresia and was ennobled with the title of Baron.

He was the founder of and professor at the High School, the forerunner of the University of Belgrade. Dositej Obradović was born in Ciacova near Timișoara in the region of Banat in the Habsburg Empire (today Romania). He became a monk in the Monastery of Novo Hopovo to the South of Novi Sad (today Serbia), received the clerical name Dositej and stayed there from 1757 to 1760. Then he abandoned his vocation and began to travel all over Europe and also Asia from 1760 to 1771, where he learned about the ideas of European Enlightenment and Rationalism. Guided by such ideas, he worked actively on the enlightening of the Serbian people, translated various works, among which the most famous are the Aesopian fables. In 1771 Dositej Obradović arrived in Vienna. In his autobiography he describes his life in Vienna from 1771 to 1777, where he was in very friendly relations with the local Serbs and Greeks. Dositej Obradović taught Ancient Greek and had in the beginning about 12 students. At the same time Dositej Obradović paid for lectures in French and Latin, but already in his third year in Vienna he also gave lectures to others in these two languages. He met all the important Serbs in Vienna, who had a remarkable influence on his social life. Among them were Atanasije Demetrović Sekereš, the Baron and General Mihailo Mikašinović (1715-1775) and his family, the Baron and General Arsenije Sečujac (1720-1814). In the house of Baron Mikašinović he gave lessons in French to Marta, the daughter of the General Sava Prodanović. Apart from the social life Dositej Obradović describes Vienna at that time and his visits to Belvedere, the Prater, Augarten and Schönbrunn. He visited the Opera, theatres and libraries. Dositej Obradović left Vienna in 1777 and after travelling all over Europe he came to Halle in Germany in 1782. Here he took off his monk's robe and started to study at the University of Halle. He attended lectures on Philosophy, Aesthetics and Theology. In this period of his life he began to write and in 1783 he published his first work entitled \"Писмо Харалампију\" (\"A Letter to Haralampije\") in Leipzig. From Germany he travelled to France and from there to London, where he stayed for six months and learned English. From 1785 he lived again in Vienna and worked as a teacher. In his autobiography he describes his relations with one of the richest Serbian merchants in Vienna at that time, Maksim Kurtović (1774-1795) and his wife Jelena (1752-1808). They were very good friends, and Dositej Obradović gave to their two daughters Marija and Hristina, lessons in French and Italian. In 1789 the Austrian general Ernst Gideon Freiherr von Laudon (1717-1790) took Belgrade from the Ottoman Empire, which was celebrated by Dositej Obradović as the beginning of the liberty of the Serbian nation in his poem \"Песна о избавленију Србије\" (\"Poem on the Salvation of Serbia\"). He printed this poem in Vienna as well as the \"Собраније\" from 1793. Dositej Obradović stayed in Vienna until 1806, writing and printing both original works and translations. After the beginning of the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire in 1804, he returned to Serbia in 1806, where he founded the High School (the forerunner of the University of Belgrade) and was the first Minister of Education in the first Serbian government.

He was the founder of and professor at the High School, the forerunner of the University of Belgrade. Dositej Obradović was born in Ciacova near Timișoara in the region of Banat in the Habsburg Empire (today Romania). He became a monk in the Monastery of Novo Hopovo to the South of Novi Sad (today Serbia), received the clerical name Dositej and stayed there from 1757 to 1760. Then he abandoned his vocation and began to travel all over Europe and also Asia from 1760 to 1771, where he learned about the ideas of European Enlightenment and Rationalism. Guided by such ideas, he worked actively on the enlightening of the Serbian people, translated various works, among which the most famous are the Aesopian fables. In 1771 Dositej Obradović arrived in Vienna. In his autobiography he describes his life in Vienna from 1771 to 1777, where he was in very friendly relations with the local Serbs and Greeks. Dositej Obradović taught Ancient Greek and had in the beginning about 12 students. At the same time Dositej Obradović paid for lectures in French and Latin, but already in his third year in Vienna he also gave lectures to others in these two languages. He met all the important Serbs in Vienna, who had a remarkable influence on his social life. Among them were Atanasije Demetrović Sekereš, the Baron and General Mihailo Mikašinović (1715-1775) and his family, the Baron and General Arsenije Sečujac (1720-1814). In the house of Baron Mikašinović he gave lessons in French to Marta, the daughter of the General Sava Prodanović. Apart from the social life Dositej Obradović describes Vienna at that time and his visits to Belvedere, the Prater, Augarten and Schönbrunn. He visited the Opera, theatres and libraries. Dositej Obradović left Vienna in 1777 and after travelling all over Europe he came to Halle in Germany in 1782. Here he took off his monk's robe and started to study at the University of Halle. He attended lectures on Philosophy, Aesthetics and Theology. In this period of his life he began to write and in 1783 he published his first work entitled \"Писмо Харалампију\" (\"A Letter to Haralampije\") in Leipzig. From Germany he travelled to France and from there to London, where he stayed for six months and learned English. From 1785 he lived again in Vienna and worked as a teacher. In his autobiography he describes his relations with one of the richest Serbian merchants in Vienna at that time, Maksim Kurtović (1774-1795) and his wife Jelena (1752-1808). They were very good friends, and Dositej Obradović gave to their two daughters Marija and Hristina, lessons in French and Italian. In 1789 the Austrian general Ernst Gideon Freiherr von Laudon (1717-1790) took Belgrade from the Ottoman Empire, which was celebrated by Dositej Obradović as the beginning of the liberty of the Serbian nation in his poem \"Песна о избавленију Србије\" (\"Poem on the Salvation of Serbia\"). He printed this poem in Vienna as well as the \"Собраније\" from 1793. Dositej Obradović stayed in Vienna until 1806, writing and printing both original works and translations. After the beginning of the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire in 1804, he returned to Serbia in 1806, where he founded the High School (the forerunner of the University of Belgrade) and was the first Minister of Education in the first Serbian government. He died on 28 March 1811 in Belgrade, where he was buried.",

In 1789 the Austrian general Ernst Gideon Freiherr von Laudon (1717-1790) took Belgrade from the Ottoman Empire, which was celebrated by Dositej Obradović as the beginning of the liberty of the Serbian nation in his poem \"Песна о избавленију Србије\" (\"Poem on the Salvation of Serbia\"). He printed this poem in Vienna as well as the \"Собраније\" from 1793. Dositej Obradović stayed in Vienna until 1806, writing and printing both original works and translations. After the beginning of the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire in 1804, he returned to Serbia in 1806, where he founded the High School (the forerunner of the University of Belgrade) and was the first Minister of Education in the first Serbian government.

He was the founder of and professor at the High School, the forerunner of the University of Belgrade. Dositej Obradović was born in Ciacova near Timișoara in the region of Banat in the Habsburg Empire (today Romania). He became a monk in the Monastery of Novo Hopovo to the South of Novi Sad (today Serbia), received the clerical name Dositej and stayed there from 1757 to 1760. Then he abandoned his vocation and began to travel all over Europe and also Asia from 1760 to 1771, where he learned about the ideas of European Enlightenment and Rationalism. Guided by such ideas, he worked actively on the enlightening of the Serbian people, translated various works, among which the most famous are the Aesopian fables. In 1771 Dositej Obradović arrived in Vienna. In his autobiography he describes his life in Vienna from 1771 to 1777, where he was in very friendly relations with the local Serbs and Greeks.

Apart from the social life Dositej Obradović describes Vienna at that time and his visits to Belvedere, the Prater, Augarten and Schönbrunn. He visited the Opera, theatres and libraries. Dositej Obradović left Vienna in 1777 and after travelling all over Europe he came to Halle in Germany in 1782. Here he took off his monk's robe and started to study at the University of Halle. He attended lectures on Philosophy, Aesthetics and Theology. In this period of his life he began to write and in 1783 he published his first work entitled \"Писмо Харалампију\" (\"A Letter to Haralampije\") in Leipzig. From Germany he travelled to France and from there to London, where he stayed for six months and learned English. From 1785 he lived again in Vienna and worked as a teacher. In his autobiography he describes his relations with one of the richest Serbian merchants in Vienna at that time, Maksim Kurtović (1774-1795) and his wife Jelena (1752-1808). They were very good friends, and Dositej Obradović gave to their two daughters Marija and Hristina, lessons in French and Italian. In 1789 the Austrian general Ernst Gideon Freiherr von Laudon (1717-1790) took Belgrade from the Ottoman Empire, which was celebrated by Dositej Obradović as the beginning of the liberty of the Serbian nation in his poem \"Песна о избавленију Србије\" (\"Poem on the Salvation of Serbia\"). He printed this poem in Vienna as well as the \"Собраније\" from 1793. Dositej Obradović stayed in Vienna until 1806, writing and printing both original works and translations. After the beginning of the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire in 1804, he returned to Serbia in 1806, where he founded the High School (the forerunner of the University of Belgrade) and was the first Minister of Education in the first Serbian government. He died on 28 March 1811 in Belgrade, where he was buried.",

        "entity_description": "Dimitrije Dositej Obradović (1739-1811) was a Serbian educator and reformer in the revolutionary period of national awakening, revival and the Enlightenment. He was the founder of and professor at the High School, the forerunner of the University of Belgrade. Dositej Obradović was born in Ciacova near Timișoara in the region of Banat in the Habsburg Empire (today Romania). He became a monk in the Monastery of Novo Hopovo to the South of Novi Sad (today Serbia), received the clerical name Dositej and stayed there from 1757 to 1760. Then he abandoned his vocation and began to travel all over Europe and also Asia from 1760 to 1771, where he learned about the ideas of European Enlightenment and Rationalism. Guided by such ideas, he worked actively on the enlightening of the Serbian people, translated various works, among which the most famous are the Aesopian fables. In 1771 Dositej Obradović arrived in Vienna. In his autobiography he describes his life in Vienna from 1771 to 1777, where he was in very friendly relations with the local Serbs and Greeks. Dositej Obradović taught Ancient Greek and had in the beginning about 12 students. At the same time Dositej Obradović paid for lectures in French and Latin, but already in his third year in Vienna he also gave lectures to others in these two languages. He met all the important Serbs in Vienna, who had a remarkable influence on his social life. Among them were Atanasije Demetrović Sekereš, the Baron and General Mihailo Mikašinović (1715-1775) and his family, the Baron and General Arsenije Sečujac (1720-1814). In the house of Baron Mikašinović he gave lessons in French to Marta, the daughter of the General Sava Prodanović. Apart from the social life Dositej Obradović describes Vienna at that time and his visits to Belvedere, the Prater, Augarten and Schönbrunn. He visited the Opera, theatres and libraries. Dositej Obradović left Vienna in 1777 and after travelling all over Europe he came to Halle in Germany in 1782. Here he took off his monk's robe and started to study at the University of Halle. He attended lectures on Philosophy, Aesthetics and Theology. In this period of his life he began to write and in 1783 he published his first work entitled \"Писмо Харалампију\" (\"A Letter to Haralampije\") in Leipzig. From Germany he travelled to France and from there to London, where he stayed for six months and learned English. From 1785 he lived again in Vienna and worked as a teacher. In his autobiography he describes his relations with one of the richest Serbian merchants in Vienna at that time, Maksim Kurtović (1774-1795) and his wife Jelena (1752-1808). They were very good friends, and Dositej Obradović gave to their two daughters Marija and Hristina, lessons in French and Italian. In 1789 the Austrian general Ernst Gideon Freiherr von Laudon (1717-1790) took Belgrade from the Ottoman Empire, which was celebrated by Dositej Obradović as the beginning of the liberty of the Serbian nation in his poem \"Песна о избавленију Србије\" (\"Poem on the Salvation of Serbia\"). He printed this poem in Vienna as well as the \"Собраније\" from 1793. Dositej Obradović stayed in Vienna until 1806, writing and printing both original works and translations. After the beginning of the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire in 1804, he returned to Serbia in 1806, where he founded the High School (the forerunner of the University of Belgrade) and was the first Minister of Education in the first Serbian government. He died on 28 March 1811 in Belgrade, where he was buried.",

As a boy he came to Belgrade, where he engaged in drawing and engraving. Due to his significant engravings he was recommended for a scholarship abroad. Upon his arrival in Vienna in 1838, as one of ten scholarship holders, he got to know the famous Greek banker Demeter Tirka (ca. 1802-1874), who became his patron. Since Anastas Jovanović did not possess the necessary knowledge for the Academy of Fine Arts (\"Akademie der bildenden Künste\"), Demeter Tirka enrolled him in the Greek National School (\"Griechische Nationalschule\"). Demeter Tirka was the patron and godfather of Vuk Stefanović Karadzić (1787-1864) and the banker of Prince Mihailo Obrenović (1823-1868). After the Greek National School, Anastas Jovanović started his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts (\"Akademie der bildenden Künste\"), which was then in the Monastery of St. Anna (\"Annakloster\"), where he studied until 1845.

    "description": "Konstantin Jovanović (1849-1923) was the son of Anastas Jovanović and a Serbian architect. He was born in Belgrade in 1849 and since the same year he lived with his father in Vienna. Like his father he continued the good relations with the Viennese Greeks, especially with the famous Tirka family. After attending grammar school in Vienna, he studied Architecture in Zurich. Then, Konstantin Jovanović moved to Vienna, where he opened an office in 1880. He married Anna Marghareta Glass in the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity in Fleischmarkt (1010 Vienna) on 7 July 1883. In this time he lived in Weintraubengasse 7 (1020 Vienna, still exists). Konstantin Jovanović was an associate of his Professor Gotfried Semper (1803-1879). Apart from buildings in Bulgaria, most of his projects can be found in Serbia. The most prominent building designed by Konstantin Jovanović was the building of the Serbian National Bank in Belgrade (still exists). From 1884 untill 1888 he lived in Ulrichgasse 1 (1020 Vienna, does not exist).  From 1888 until 1907 his address was Untere Donaustraße 35 (1020 Vienna, does not exist).

He was one of the most educated Serbs and famous benefactor, who bequeathed his entire property to the cultural and educational enlightenment of the Serbian people. \nSava Tekelija was an official, merchant, landlord and nobleman.He was the President of the “Matica Srpska” and the founder of the foundation \"Tekelijanum\" in Pest (today Hungary). He was born in Arad (today Romania) on 17 August 1761. After taking part in the Austro-Ottoman war, Sava's grandfather, Jovan Popović Tekelija, was appointed by Prince Eugene of Savoy (1663-1736) as the captain of the Serbian police (300 pistols and 200 horsemen) in 1698 and was ordered to build the fortress of Arad. In 1705 the construction of the church of St. Peter and Paul, the so-called Tekelija church, was finished. The family Tekelija remained the patron of this church until 1844, when Petar Tekelija (1784-1844), the last male descendant, died. Here is to be found the place of burial of Sava Tekelija. In 1706 Jovan Popović Tekelija was ennobled and received a coat of arms.\nIn the years 1779/80 Sava Tekelija wrote that his cousin from Russia came, gave him 100 rubles and took him to Vienna. For that money he bought a new suit and a golden watch. The first stay of Sava Tekelija in Vienna was from 1780 to 1782. Allegedly he came to Vienna by his parent's will, but he failed to enroll in the Military Academy. In Vienna he acquired rich knowledge. Sava Tekelija attended lectures at University (criminal, canonical, natural and general law, physics, anatomy, chemistry, botany), learned to draw and to play flute and the languages French, Italian and Spanish. From 1782 to 1786 he studied Law in Buda (today Hungary), where he received the title of Dr of Law as the first among the Serbs. In 1804 Sava Tekelija wrote to Napoleon I (1769-1821), proposing to him that he should establish a Kingdom of Illyria, which would include Serbia, Croatia, Dalmatia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Boka Kotorska and Dubrovnik. In 1805 he addressed the Austrian Emperor Franz I (1768-1835) with a proposal of cooperation between Austria and Russia against Germany and France.\nIn August 1745 Empress Maria Theresia (1717-1780) founded the so-called \"Illyrische Hofkommission\" for the Serbian population of her realm and its administration. On 5 August 1747 it was renamed in \"Illyrische Hofdeputation\" and put under the direct control of the Habsburg ruler. The \"Illyrische Hofdeputation\" issued two Regulamenta in 1770 and 1777 and was finally dissolved in 1792. Its successor was the Hungarian Court Office. During his second stay in Vienna from 1792 to 1798 Sava Tekelija was secretary at the Hungarian Court Office. He fought for the rights of the Serbian people in Hungary, but, since he had no support in the office, decided to resign in October 1798. On this occasion he wrote in his diary about his audience to Emperor Franz I.\nSince then Sava Tekelija was staying in Vienna on at least three occasions: in 1804, when he wrote the letter to Napoleon I, which he sent through the French deputy; in 1805, when he printed his map of Serbia and other countries in 2,000 copies; in 1838, when he was on his way to Bavaria for medical treatment, to take a passport. In 1838 he recorded that he saw \"steam cars on the railroad tracks, from Prater to Wagram.\" After returning from the treatment, he stayed in Vienna in order to obtain a permission to establish his foundation, which became to be known as \"Tekelijanum\". In the \"Tekelijanum\" in Pest more than 350 Serbian students, among them the famous Serbian scientist Nikola Tesla (1856-1943), were accepted from 1838 to 1914 and received scholarships. In addition Sava Tekelija stated that two children of Serbian officers should be sent to the Viennese Engineering Academy and later, that more than 20 Serbian children in Vienna should be educated. For the same reason, Sava Tekelija resided again in Vienna in June 1840. In addition to the \"Tekelijanum\" he also left 100,000 forints for the Serbian students of the Engineering Academy. Four students, who were to be named by the Metropolitan of Sremski Karlovci, were to receive 4,000 forints. Jovan Subotić (1817-1886) states in his book on Sava Tekelija from 1861 that until that time 30-40 young men had already received a scholarship at the Viennese Engineering Academy.

In 1804 Sava Tekelija wrote to Napoleon I (1769-1821), proposing to him that he should establish a Kingdom of Illyria, which would include Serbia, Croatia, Dalmatia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Boka Kotorska and Dubrovnik. In 1805 he addressed the Austrian Emperor Franz I (1768-1835) with a proposal of cooperation between Austria and Russia against Germany and France.\nIn August 1745 Empress Maria Theresia (1717-1780) founded the so-called \"Illyrische Hofkommission\" for the Serbian population of her realm and its administration. On 5 August 1747 it was renamed in \"Illyrische Hofdeputation\" and put under the direct control of the Habsburg ruler. The \"Illyrische Hofdeputation\" issued two Regulamenta in 1770 and 1777 and was finally dissolved in 1792. Its successor was the Hungarian Court Office. During his second stay in Vienna from 1792 to 1798 Sava Tekelija was secretary at the Hungarian Court Office. He fought for the rights of the Serbian people in Hungary, but, since he had no support in the office, decided to resign in October 1798. On this occasion he wrote in his diary about his audience to Emperor Franz I.\nSince then Sava Tekelija was staying in Vienna on at least three occasions: in 1804, when he wrote the letter to Napoleon I, which he sent through the French deputy; in 1805, when he printed his map of Serbia and other countries in 2,000 copies; in 1838, when he was on his way to Bavaria for medical treatment, to take a passport. In 1838 he recorded that he saw \"steam cars on the railroad tracks, from Prater to Wagram.\" After returning from the treatment, he stayed in Vienna in order to obtain a permission to establish his foundation, which became to be known as \"Tekelijanum\". In the \"Tekelijanum\" in Pest more than 350 Serbian students, among them the famous Serbian scientist Nikola Tesla (1856-1943), were accepted from 1838 to 1914 and received scholarships. In addition Sava Tekelija stated that two children of Serbian officers should be sent to the Viennese Engineering Academy and later, that more than 20 Serbian children in Vienna should be educated. For the same reason, Sava Tekelija resided again in Vienna in June 1840. In addition to the \"Tekelijanum\" he also left 100,000 forints for the Serbian students of the Engineering Academy. Four students, who were to be named by the Metropolitan of Sremski Karlovci, were to receive 4,000 forints. Jovan Subotić (1817-1886) states in his book on Sava Tekelija from 1861 that until that time 30-40 young men had already received a scholarship at the Viennese Engineering Academy. Sava Tekelija died in Arad on 21 September 1842.",

The education reform of the Serbs was only one of a series of reforms carried out in the 1770s, which had far-reaching consequences not only on the legal and political situation of the Serbs, but also on the development of spiritual life. The reforms were implemented through two Regulations (1770 and 1777), then the Declarations (1779) and the Consistory System (1782). One of the measures implemented was the opening of a printing press for publications printed in Cyrillic, which had a positive effect on the spreading of books among the Serbs.

Being a friend of the Serbian philologist and linguist Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (1787-1864), he painted his portrait in Vienna in 1840. This painting (oil on canvas) is preserved today in the Serbian National Museum (\"Narodni Muzej\") in Belgrade. He painted also the iconostases in many Serbian Orthodox Churches. The most valuable is the iconostasis in the St. Michael's Cathedral (\"Saborna Crkva\") in Belgrade (1841-1845). From 1852 he lived in Novi Sad, where he died on 1 March 1855.",

    "description": "Djordje Stratimirović Ritter von Kulpin (1822-1908) was a prominent Serbian army commander in the Vojvodina and a Major General in the Austrian Army. He was born in Novi Sad (today Serbia). His ancestor was Bogić Vučković von Stratimirović, originally from Herzegovina, who fought on the side of the Habsburg Empire in the Austro-Ottoman War of 1737-1739. Due to his merits he received by the Empress Maria Theresia (1717-1780) the landed property of Kulpin as well as Hungarian nobility, together with his brothers Ivan, Toma and Nikola. \nDjordje Stratimirović attended the Viennese Engineering Academy from 1837 to 1841. He was the military leader of the Serbs, who were loyal to the Habsburg Dynasty in the revolution of 1848-1849, against the Hungarians.

        "entity_description": "Djordje Stratimirović Ritter von Kulpin (1822-1908) was a prominent Serbian army commander in the Vojvodina and a Major General in the Austrian Army. He was born in Novi Sad (today Serbia). His ancestor was Bogić Vučković von Stratimirović, originally from Herzegovina, who fought on the side of the Habsburg Empire in the Austro-Ottoman War of 1737-1739. Due to his merits he received by the Empress Maria Theresia (1717-1780) the landed property of Kulpin as well as Hungarian nobility, together with his brothers Ivan, Toma and Nikola. \nDjordje Stratimirović attended the Viennese Engineering Academy from 1837 to 1841. He was the military leader of the Serbs, who were loyal to the Habsburg Dynasty in the revolution of 1848-1849, against the Hungarians. At an assembly in May 1848 he was elected president of the main committee of the Serbian people and provisional army chief. In October 1848 Djordje Stratimirović left the command of the army to Stevan Šupljikac (1786-1848) and took on the task to go to to Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916) in order to obtain the recognition of the decisions of the May Assembly. In Djordje 1849 Stratimirović re-entered the Austrian Army in the rank of colonel at the invitation of Prince Felix Schwarzenberg (1800-1852). Djordje Stratimirović married Albine von Beck on 10 May 1854 in the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity in Fleischmarkt (1010 Vienna). They were married by the Bishop Platon Atanacković (1788-1867) of Novi Sad and  Stratimirović's best man was Prince Mihailo Obrenović (1823-1868). After the church ceremony a wedding celebration was held at the Hotel \"Stadt London\". The godfathers of Stratimirović's children were the Princes Mihailo Obrenović and Milan Obrenović (1854-1901). \nIn 1859 Djordje Stratimirović left the military service in the rank of Major General. After his military career he was engaged in diplomacy and politics. He fulfilled diplomatic missions in Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Epirus and Corfu, and was Governor of Dalmatia and General Consul in Sicily. In the Hungarian Parliament (1865-1872) he led the Serbian conservatives in their fight against the political subjugation of the Serbs. In the autumn of 1877 Djordje Stratimirović settled in Vienna, where he remained until the end of his life. \nHe wrote articles for many newspapers, namely \"Politik\", \"Wiener Tagblatt\", \"Vorstadtzeitung\", \"Wiener Allgemeine Zeitung\", \"Vaterland\" and \"Tribüne\". Djordje Stratimirović published his paper \"Ausgrabungen auf der Hochebene Glasinac im Jahre 1891. Vorläufiger Bericht. Mit 33 Abbildungen\" in the journal \"Wissenschaftliche Mitteilungen aus Bosnien und der Herzegowina\" in 1893 (volume 1, pages 113-125.). In 1896 King Aleksandar Obrenović (1876-1903) honored him with the Order of the Takovo Cross. In 1907 he was honored with the Leopold Order and knighted by the Emperor Franz Joseph I (becoming Ritter von). Djordje Stratimirović died on 15 December 1908 in his apartment in Klagbaumgasse 17 (1040 Vienna), where he had lived since 1894. Emperor Franz Joseph I received the news of his death with great regret. A memorial service was held in the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava in Vienna by Bishop Nikodim Milaš of Dalmatia (1845-1915).

    "description": "Milutin Milanković (1879-1958) was born on 28 May 1879 in Dalj near Osijek (today Croatia), in what was then Austria-Hungary. He was a Serbian mathematician and geophysicist, who studied civil engineering at the then College of Technology (\"Technische Hochschule\") in Vienna (now TU Vienna) and received his PhD there in 1904. This led to a successful, but short career as a technician. Milutin Milanković worked on major construction projects in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Among other things, he also designed the reinforced concrete ceilings for the Karlstrakt of the main building of the Technical University in Vienna. During this time, he developed and patented new approaches to concrete construction. In 1909 Milutin Milanković left Vienna and accepted a Professorship in Applied Mathematics at the University of Belgrade. This marked a turning point in his life. In addition to dealing with engineering-technical concrete construction problems, he turned increasingly to basic astronomical-mathematical research, especially on questions of the development of the Earth's climate. He achieved great fame with the calculation of the Milanković cycles concerning the seasonal variations of solar radiation and their effects on the climate, the validity of which has long been very controversial.\nMilutin Milanković contributed with three fundamental achievements to science: astronomical theories of climate change, theories of the movement of the Earth's poles and a revised Julian Calendar. Milanković's revised Julian Calendar (1923) is astronomically the most accurate calendar so far (corresponding to the date of the Gregorian Calendar), which would need correction only after the year 28,800.\nAfter the scientific verifications of Milanković's theories and results he received international acknowledgment by the World's scientific community (also posthumous):\nIn 1970 on the XIV Congress of the International Astronomical Union in the Brighton one crater on the Moon (measure 34 km; coordinates + 170, +77) recieved the Milanković's name. In 1973 on the XV Congress of the International Astronomical Union in Sydney one crater on the Mars (measure 118 km, coordinates + 147, + 55) was also named after Milanković. In 1980 the Asteroid 1605 (marks 1936GA), which had been discovered by the Serbian astronomers Milorad Protić and Petar Ćurković, received Milanković's name. In 1993 the European Geosciences Union established the Milutin Milanković Medal as a prize for the acknowledgment to scientists for extraordinary research reports in the field long-term climate changes. It is awarded to scientists for their outstanding research in long-term climatic changes and modelling. \nMilutin Milanković was elected a Corresponding Member of the Serbian Royal Academy (today Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts) in 1920 and a Full Member in 1924, a Corresponding Member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb in 1925 and a Member of the German Academy of Naturalists \"Leopoldine\" in Halle.

    "description": "Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (1787-1864) was a Serbian philologist and linguist and greatest reformer of the Serbian language. He became also well known for his collection of Serbian folk songs, fairy tailes and riddles. Vuk Stefanović Karadžić lived and worked in Vienna for more than 50 years. He moved there in 1813 after the end of the First Serbian Uprising (1804-1813) against the Ottoman Empire. In Vienna Vuk Stefanović Karadžić met Jernej Kopitar (1780-1844), a Slovenian philologist and censor at the Imperial Library, who encouraged Vuk in his collection of folk material. Vuk met Dimitrije Davidović, Dimitrije Frušić and Sava Mrkalj in Pest and stayed in contact with them also in Vienna. Vuk printed his first book entitled \"Pesnarica\" (a collection of Serbian folk songs) in Vienna in the Schnierer publishing house in 1,500 copies. In the same year Vuk printed the book \"Pismenica\"  (\"Pismenica serbskoga jezika\"), the first grammar of the reformed Serbian language. Vuk published a new edition in 1818, which was translated by the famous German philologist Jacob Grimm (1785-1863) into the German language in 1824 (entitled \"Kleine serbische Grammatik\"). Grimm was impressed by the Serbian cultural heritage in the form of folk poems and songs. Vuk met Jacob Grimm in 1823 and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) in his house in Weimar in 1824. Goethe was interested in Serbian folk poetry since the year 1778, when he translated \"Hasanaginica\", a South Slavic folk ballad. From 1823 to 1827 Goethe translated folk songs from Vuk's books in the journal \"Über Kunst und Alterthum\", the first one was \"Dioba Jakšića\" (\"Erbschaftsteilung\"). Apart from Goethe and Grimm Vuk's folk songs were translated into Czech (\"Prostonárodní srbská muza, do Cech převedená\", 1817), English (\"Servian popular poetry\", 1827), Swedish (\"Serbiska folksänger\", 1830), Hungarian (\"Szerb népdalok hősregék\", 1836) and into Polish (\"Narodowe piesni serbskie\", 1853). Kopitar introduced Vuk to Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886), one of the greatest German historians, in 1827. On the basis of Vuk's knowledge of the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire, Ranke published his book on the \"Serbian revolution\" in 1828.\nVuk's Serbian-German Dictionary, printed in 1818 in the publishing house of the Armenian Mechitarist Monastery (Mechitaristengasse 4, 1070 Vienna), was the first book ever printed in the newly reformed Serbian language. Vuk standardised the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet based on the phonemic principle of Johann Christoph Adellung (1732-1806), a great German philologist. His motto was: \"Write as you speak, and read as it is written\". This book was printed from donations, firstly by Theodor Demeter Tirka (1764-1839), a Greek merchant and banker from Vienna, who was also godfather of Vuk's children.\nVuk married Anna Kraus (1788-1876) in the Roman Catholic Church of St. Rochus (Landstraßer Hauptstraße 54-56, 1030 Vienna) on 28 January 1818. His best man was Jernej Kopitar. Vuk's first rented apartment was that of Anna's father, where they met. During his life in Vienna Vuk changed address more than 20 times. The couple had 12 children, but only two of them overlived Vuk: his daughter Wilhelmine-Mina (1828-1894) and his son Dimitrije (1836-1883). \nVuk was very active in the social life among the Viennese Serbs. He was a friend of Prince Miloš Obrenović and Prince Mihailo Obrenović, Petar Petrović Njegoš, Djura Daničić, Branko Radičević, Anastas Jovanović, etc. Vuk was also very reputable among all Slavs, his friends and associates were the Russian priest Michail Fjodorowitsch Rajewski (1811-1844), Jernej Kopitar, Josef Dobrovský (1753-1829), František Palacký (1798-1876), Pavel Jozef Šafárik (1795-1861), Franz Xaver Ritter von Miklosich (1813-1891), etc. Vuk was often guest in the so-called \"Slavonic Café\" (also \"Café Gerlovich\"), also \"Zum Weissen Wolfen\" (Fleischmarkt 20/Wolfengasse 3, 1010 Vienna), and other places where the Slavs gathered in Vienna. \nIn 1823 Vuk became honorary Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Jena. In 1826 Vuk received a Russian and in 1835 a Serbian pension. He was very reputable in the Russian Empire. Apart from the pension the Russian Emperor Nikolaj I Pavlovič (1796-1855) honored him with the Gold medal in 1841 and in 1862 he was awarded with the Order of St. Anna 2nd class with crown. Vuk became a corresponding member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna on 14 January 1848. Three days before he had received a ring with brilliants as a gift of the Austrian Emperor Ferdinand I (1793-1875), who thanked him for his book of Serbian folk songs entitled \"Srpske Narodne pjesme\". In 1850 the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916) honored Vuk with the Knight's Cross of the Franz Josef Order 3rd class and in 1851 with the Gold Medal for Science. Vuk was also awarded the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle 3rd class in 1852.\nVuk died in his appartment, where he spent his last 15 years of life, in Marokkanergasse 3 (1030 Vienna) on 7 February 1864. After the memorial service in the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George in Griechengasse 5 (1010 Vienna) he was buried in the Orthodox part of the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna). His mortal remains were transferred to Belgrade in 1897, while the tombstone still stands in the Orthodox part of the St. Marx Cemetery. On the house in Marokkanergasse 3 (1030 Vienna) a memorial plaque was placed in the 1950s, and Vuk’s monument was erected in Rasumofskygasse 22 (1030 Vienna) in 1987.",

Vuk printed his first book entitled \"Pesnarica\" (a collection of Serbian folk songs) in Vienna in the Schnierer publishing house in 1,500 copies. In the same year Vuk printed the book \"Pismenica\"  (\"Pismenica serbskoga jezika\"), the first grammar of the reformed Serbian language. Vuk published a new edition in 1818, which was translated by the famous German philologist Jacob Grimm (1785-1863) into the German language in 1824 (entitled \"Kleine serbische Grammatik\"). Grimm was impressed by the Serbian cultural heritage in the form of folk poems and songs. Vuk met Jacob Grimm in 1823 and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) in his house in Weimar in 1824. Goethe was interested in Serbian folk poetry since the year 1778, when he translated \"Hasanaginica\", a South Slavic folk ballad. From 1823 to 1827 Goethe translated folk songs from Vuk's books in the journal \"Über Kunst und Alterthum\", the first one was \"Dioba Jakšića\" (\"Erbschaftsteilung\").

Apart from Goethe and Grimm Vuk's folk songs were translated into Czech (\"Prostonárodní srbská muza, do Cech převedená\", 1817), English (\"Servian popular poetry\", 1827), Swedish (\"Serbiska folksänger\", 1830), Hungarian (\"Szerb népdalok hősregék\", 1836) and into Polish (\"Narodowe piesni serbskie\", 1853). Kopitar introduced Vuk to Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886), one of the greatest German historians, in 1827. On the basis of Vuk's knowledge of the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire, Ranke published his book on the \"Serbian revolution\" in 1828.\nVuk's Serbian-German Dictionary, printed in 1818 in the publishing house of the Armenian Mechitarist Monastery (Mechitaristengasse 4, 1070 Vienna), was the first book ever printed in the newly reformed Serbian language. Vuk standardised the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet based on the phonemic principle of Johann Christoph Adellung (1732-1806), a great German philologist. His motto was: \"Write as you speak, and read as it is written\". This book was printed from donations, firstly by Theodor Demeter Tirka (1764-1839), a Greek merchant and banker from Vienna, who was also godfather of Vuk's children.\nVuk married Anna Kraus (1788-1876) in the Roman Catholic Church of St. Rochus (Landstraßer Hauptstraße 54-56, 1030 Vienna) on 28 January 1818. His best man was Jernej Kopitar. Vuk's first rented apartment was that of Anna's father, where they met. During his life in Vienna Vuk changed address more than 20 times. The couple had 12 children, but only two of them overlived Vuk: his daughter Wilhelmine-Mina (1828-1894) and his son Dimitrije (1836-1883). \nVuk was very active in the social life among the Viennese Serbs. He was a friend of Prince Miloš Obrenović and Prince Mihailo Obrenović, Petar Petrović Njegoš, Djura Daničić, Branko Radičević, Anastas Jovanović, etc. Vuk was also very reputable among all Slavs, his friends and associates were the Russian priest Michail Fjodorowitsch Rajewski (1811-1844), Jernej Kopitar, Josef Dobrovský (1753-1829), František Palacký (1798-1876), Pavel Jozef Šafárik (1795-1861), Franz Xaver Ritter von Miklosich (1813-1891), etc. Vuk was often guest in the so-called \"Slavonic Café\" (also \"Café Gerlovich\"), also \"Zum Weissen Wolfen\" (Fleischmarkt 20/Wolfengasse 3, 1010 Vienna), and other places where the Slavs gathered in Vienna. \nIn 1823 Vuk became honorary Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Jena. In 1826 Vuk received a Russian and in 1835 a Serbian pension. He was very reputable in the Russian Empire. Apart from the pension the Russian Emperor Nikolaj I Pavlovič (1796-1855) honored him with the Gold medal in 1841 and in 1862 he was awarded with the Order of St. Anna 2nd class with crown. Vuk became a corresponding member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna on 14 January 1848. Three days before he had received a ring with brilliants as a gift of the Austrian Emperor Ferdinand I (1793-1875), who thanked him for his book of Serbian folk songs entitled \"Srpske Narodne pjesme\". In 1850 the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916) honored Vuk with the Knight's Cross of the Franz Josef Order 3rd class and in 1851 with the Gold Medal for Science. Vuk was also awarded the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle 3rd class in 1852.\nVuk died in his appartment, where he spent his last 15 years of life, in Marokkanergasse 3 (1030 Vienna) on 7 February 1864. After the memorial service in the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George in Griechengasse 5 (1010 Vienna) he was buried in the Orthodox part of the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna). His mortal remains were transferred to Belgrade in 1897, while the tombstone still stands in the Orthodox part of the St. Marx Cemetery. On the house in Marokkanergasse 3 (1030 Vienna) a memorial plaque was placed in the 1950s, and Vuk’s monument was erected in Rasumofskygasse 22 (1030 Vienna) in 1987.",

Grimm was impressed by the Serbian cultural heritage in the form of folk poems and songs. Vuk met Jacob Grimm in 1823 and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) in his house in Weimar in 1824. Goethe was interested in Serbian folk poetry since the year 1778, when he translated \"Hasanaginica\", a South Slavic folk ballad. From 1823 to 1827 Goethe translated folk songs from Vuk's books in the journal \"Über Kunst und Alterthum\", the first one was \"Dioba Jakšića\" (\"Erbschaftsteilung\"). Apart from Goethe and Grimm Vuk's folk songs were translated into Czech (\"Prostonárodní srbská muza, do Cech převedená\", 1817), English (\"Servian popular poetry\", 1827), Swedish (\"Serbiska folksänger\", 1830), Hungarian (\"Szerb népdalok hősregék\", 1836) and into Polish (\"Narodowe piesni serbskie\", 1853). Kopitar introduced Vuk to Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886), one of the greatest German historians, in 1827. On the basis of Vuk's knowledge of the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire, Ranke published his book on the \"Serbian revolution\" in 1828.\nVuk's Serbian-German Dictionary, printed in 1818 in the publishing house of the Armenian Mechitarist Monastery (Mechitaristengasse 4, 1070 Vienna), was the first book ever printed in the newly reformed Serbian language. Vuk standardised the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet based on the phonemic principle of Johann Christoph Adellung (1732-1806), a great German philologist. His motto was: \"Write as you speak, and read as it is written\". This book was printed from donations, firstly by Theodor Demeter Tirka (1764-1839), a Greek merchant and banker from Vienna, who was also godfather of Vuk's children.\nVuk married Anna Kraus (1788-1876) in the Roman Catholic Church of St. Rochus (Landstraßer Hauptstraße 54-56, 1030 Vienna) on 28 January 1818. His best man was Jernej Kopitar. Vuk's first rented apartment was that of Anna's father, where they met. During his life in Vienna Vuk changed address more than 20 times. The couple had 12 children, but only two of them overlived Vuk: his daughter Wilhelmine-Mina (1828-1894) and his son Dimitrije (1836-1883). \nVuk was very active in the social life among the Viennese Serbs. He was a friend of Prince Miloš Obrenović and Prince Mihailo Obrenović, Petar Petrović Njegoš, Djura Daničić, Branko Radičević, Anastas Jovanović, etc. Vuk was also very reputable among all Slavs, his friends and associates were the Russian priest Michail Fjodorowitsch Rajewski (1811-1844), Jernej Kopitar, Josef Dobrovský (1753-1829), František Palacký (1798-1876), Pavel Jozef Šafárik (1795-1861), Franz Xaver Ritter von Miklosich (1813-1891), etc. Vuk was often guest in the so-called \"Slavonic Café\" (also \"Café Gerlovich\"), also \"Zum Weissen Wolfen\" (Fleischmarkt 20/Wolfengasse 3, 1010 Vienna), and other places where the Slavs gathered in Vienna. \nIn 1823 Vuk became honorary Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Jena. In 1826 Vuk received a Russian and in 1835 a Serbian pension. He was very reputable in the Russian Empire. Apart from the pension the Russian Emperor Nikolaj I Pavlovič (1796-1855) honored him with the Gold medal in 1841 and in 1862 he was awarded with the Order of St. Anna 2nd class with crown. Vuk became a corresponding member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna on 14 January 1848. Three days before he had received a ring with brilliants as a gift of the Austrian Emperor Ferdinand I (1793-1875), who thanked him for his book of Serbian folk songs entitled \"Srpske Narodne pjesme\". In 1850 the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916) honored Vuk with the Knight's Cross of the Franz Josef Order 3rd class and in 1851 with the Gold Medal for Science. Vuk was also awarded the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle 3rd class in 1852.\nVuk died in his appartment, where he spent his last 15 years of life, in Marokkanergasse 3 (1030 Vienna) on 7 February 1864. After the memorial service in the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George in Griechengasse 5 (1010 Vienna) he was buried in the Orthodox part of the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna). His mortal remains were transferred to Belgrade in 1897, while the tombstone still stands in the Orthodox part of the St. Marx Cemetery. On the house in Marokkanergasse 3 (1030 Vienna) a memorial plaque was placed in the 1950s, and Vuk’s monument was erected in Rasumofskygasse 22 (1030 Vienna) in 1987.",

He became also well known for his collection of Serbian folk songs, fairy tailes and riddles. Vuk Stefanović Karadžić lived and worked in Vienna for more than 50 years. He moved there in 1813 after the end of the First Serbian Uprising (1804-1813) against the Ottoman Empire. In Vienna Vuk Stefanović Karadžić met Jernej Kopitar (1780-1844), a Slovenian philologist and censor at the Imperial Library, who encouraged Vuk in his collection of folk material. Vuk met Dimitrije Davidović, Dimitrije Frušić and Sava Mrkalj in Pest and stayed in contact with them also in Vienna. Vuk printed his first book entitled \"Pesnarica\" (a collection of Serbian folk songs) in Vienna in the Schnierer publishing house in 1,500 copies. In the same year Vuk printed the book \"Pismenica\"  (\"Pismenica serbskoga jezika\"), the first grammar of the reformed Serbian language. Vuk published a new edition in 1818, which was translated by the famous German philologist Jacob Grimm (1785-1863) into the German language in 1824 (entitled \"Kleine serbische Grammatik\"). Grimm was impressed by the Serbian cultural heritage in the form of folk poems and songs. Vuk met Jacob Grimm in 1823 and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) in his house in Weimar in 1824. Goethe was interested in Serbian folk poetry since the year 1778, when he translated \"Hasanaginica\", a South Slavic folk ballad. From 1823 to 1827 Goethe translated folk songs from Vuk's books in the journal \"Über Kunst und Alterthum\", the first one was \"Dioba Jakšića\" (\"Erbschaftsteilung\"). Apart from Goethe and Grimm Vuk's folk songs were translated into Czech (\"Prostonárodní srbská muza, do Cech převedená\", 1817), English (\"Servian popular poetry\", 1827), Swedish (\"Serbiska folksänger\", 1830), Hungarian (\"Szerb népdalok hősregék\", 1836) and into Polish (\"Narodowe piesni serbskie\", 1853). Kopitar introduced Vuk to Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886), one of the greatest German historians, in 1827. On the basis of Vuk's knowledge of the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire, Ranke published his book on the \"Serbian revolution\" in 1828.\nVuk's Serbian-German Dictionary, printed in 1818 in the publishing house of the Armenian Mechitarist Monastery (Mechitaristengasse 4, 1070 Vienna), was the first book ever printed in the newly reformed Serbian language. Vuk standardised the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet based on the phonemic principle of Johann Christoph Adellung (1732-1806), a great German philologist. His motto was: \"Write as you speak, and read as it is written\". This book was printed from donations, firstly by Theodor Demeter Tirka (1764-1839), a Greek merchant and banker from Vienna, who was also godfather of Vuk's children.\nVuk married Anna Kraus (1788-1876) in the Roman Catholic Church of St. Rochus (Landstraßer Hauptstraße 54-56, 1030 Vienna) on 28 January 1818.

        "entity_description": "Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (1787-1864) was a Serbian philologist and linguist and greatest reformer of the Serbian language. He became also well known for his collection of Serbian folk songs, fairy tailes and riddles. Vuk Stefanović Karadžić lived and worked in Vienna for more than 50 years. He moved there in 1813 after the end of the First Serbian Uprising (1804-1813) against the Ottoman Empire. In Vienna Vuk Stefanović Karadžić met Jernej Kopitar (1780-1844), a Slovenian philologist and censor at the Imperial Library, who encouraged Vuk in his collection of folk material. Vuk met Dimitrije Davidović, Dimitrije Frušić and Sava Mrkalj in Pest and stayed in contact with them also in Vienna. Vuk printed his first book entitled \"Pesnarica\" (a collection of Serbian folk songs) in Vienna in the Schnierer publishing house in 1,500 copies. In the same year Vuk printed the book \"Pismenica\"  (\"Pismenica serbskoga jezika\"), the first grammar of the reformed Serbian language. Vuk published a new edition in 1818, which was translated by the famous German philologist Jacob Grimm (1785-1863) into the German language in 1824 (entitled \"Kleine serbische Grammatik\"). Grimm was impressed by the Serbian cultural heritage in the form of folk poems and songs. Vuk met Jacob Grimm in 1823 and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) in his house in Weimar in 1824. Goethe was interested in Serbian folk poetry since the year 1778, when he translated \"Hasanaginica\", a South Slavic folk ballad. From 1823 to 1827 Goethe translated folk songs from Vuk's books in the journal \"Über Kunst und Alterthum\", the first one was \"Dioba Jakšića\" (\"Erbschaftsteilung\"). Apart from Goethe and Grimm Vuk's folk songs were translated into Czech (\"Prostonárodní srbská muza, do Cech převedená\", 1817), English (\"Servian popular poetry\", 1827), Swedish (\"Serbiska folksänger\", 1830), Hungarian (\"Szerb népdalok hősregék\", 1836) and into Polish (\"Narodowe piesni serbskie\", 1853). Kopitar introduced Vuk to Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886), one of the greatest German historians, in 1827. On the basis of Vuk's knowledge of the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire, Ranke published his book on the \"Serbian revolution\" in 1828.\nVuk's Serbian-German Dictionary, printed in 1818 in the publishing house of the Armenian Mechitarist Monastery (Mechitaristengasse 4, 1070 Vienna), was the first book ever printed in the newly reformed Serbian language. Vuk standardised the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet based on the phonemic principle of Johann Christoph Adellung (1732-1806), a great German philologist. His motto was: \"Write as you speak, and read as it is written\". This book was printed from donations, firstly by Theodor Demeter Tirka (1764-1839), a Greek merchant and banker from Vienna, who was also godfather of Vuk's children.\nVuk married Anna Kraus (1788-1876) in the Roman Catholic Church of St. Rochus (Landstraßer Hauptstraße 54-56, 1030 Vienna) on 28 January 1818.

In 1863 he received a scholarship by the Serbian government in order to study Medicine at the University of Vienna. His first apartment was in Wieden (1040 Vienna), and he attended lectures at the Theresianum. His professors were renowned experts in medicine: Josef von Škoda (1805-1881), Theodor Billroth (1829-1894) and Joseph Hyrtl (1810-1894). During his studies he regularly attended performances in the Burgtheater. Vladan Djordjević graduated in 1869 and in the same year he became Doctor of Medicine and Surgery. During his studies in Vienna he met his future wife Pauline Bitner. They married in Belgrade in 1871. In 1870 he became a member of the Society of Physicians in Vienna (\"Gesellschaft der Ärzte in Wien\"). Djordjević was the founder of the Serbian Physicians' Society (\"Srpsko Lekarsko Društvo\") in 1872 and of the Serbian Red Cross in 1876. Then Vladan Djordjević started a political career.

In his work \"Komentari\" (\"Comments\") he described his Viennese days. He lived in Piaristengasse 54 (1080 Vienna) in the guesthouse of Mrs. Thiess. Crnjanski was a member of the Serbian Students' Association \"Zora\". His memoirs are very interesting, especially because of the events on and after 28 June 1914. Crnjanski played pool in Meinl Café on that day, when he heard the news about the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand (1863-1914) in Sarajevo. Early in the morning on that day he was on a meeting with Serbian, Croatian and Slovenian students in honour of the Serbian national day – Vidovdan.

As a Serbian student and member of the Serbian Students' Association \"Zora\", Crnjanski was, as the others, suspicious in the eyes of the Viennese police. Shortly after that, Crnjanski moved to Novi Sad, and later he was arrested and mobilised in the Austro-Hungarian Army. After the First World War (1914-1918) he moved to Belgrade, where he studied literature and worked as a teacher and newspaper editor (of the newspaper \"Ideje\"). From 1935 Miloš Crnjanski was in the diplomatic service of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in Rome and Berlin. Together with the government he escaped from the German invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941 to London via Lisbon. In London he continued his diplomatic activities as a member of a recognised Allied country. After the Second World War (1939-1945) he stayed in London in exile as an enemy of the newly established Communist regime in Socialist Yugoslavia. He returned to Belgrade from exile twenty years later, in 1965, where he died in 1977.

    "description": "Jovan Cvijić (1865-1927) is the best-known Serbian geologist and geographer. He was born on 12 October 1865 in Loznica (Serbia). After attending grammar school in Loznica and Šabac, he studied Natural Sciences and Mathematics at the Faculty of the High School in Belgrade from 1885 to 1888. After completing his studies, he began his systematic field trips through the Balkan Peninsula for the next 38 years. Jovan Cvijić researched more than 500,000 square kilometers of territory. In autumn 1889 he came to Vienna as a scholarship holder. He attended lectures on Physical Geography and Cartography. On 22 January 1893 he was promoted to Dr. His PhD was entitled \"Das Karstphänomen\" (\"The Karst Phenomenon\"). For the first time this work was printed in Vienna in the autumn of the same year. Great influence on the young Jovan Cvijić had his professors at the University of Vienna (i.e. Eduard Suess, Albrecht Penck, Julius Hann and Wilhelm Tomascheck). He often had meetings with Professor Albrecht Penck (1858-1945), where the topic of conversation was the geography of the Balkan Peninsula. His dissertation is still considered to be a fundamental work in the field of Karstology. Jovan Cvijić was the leading Karstologist of his generation, and probably the greatest Karstologist of the 19th and early 20th centuries. He has often been called the \"Father of Karst Studies\". \nIt is also important to say that Jovan Cvijić introduced several Serbian words to the scientific terminology, like Polje, Dolina, Uvala. From 1893 until his death in 1927 he was a Professor, first at the High School in Belgrade, and from 1905 (after the conversion of the High School in Belgrade to the University of Belgrade on 27 February 1905) full Professor of the University of Belgrade. He was also twice Rector of the University of Belgrade (1907/08 and 1919/20) and President of the Serbian Royal Academy (today Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts) from 1921 to 1927. \nJovan Cvijić was the founder of the Serbian Geographical Society (\"Srpsko geografsko društvo\", 1910) and the journal of the Serbian Geographical Society (\"Glasnik Srpskog geografskog društva\", 1912), which is still published today. In addition to his fundamental works on Geomorphology, Geography and Geology his anthropological and ethnographic publications are outstanding. He was the founder of the Serbian settlement research. \nJovan Cvijić played an eminent role in the Paris Peace Conference after the First World War (1919/20). He was the head of the Serbian ethnographic-historical department (in this delegation were, amongst others, the Serbian historians and former Viennese students Tihomir Djordjević, Jovan Radonić and StanojeStanojević). This department had collected scholarly, statistical and cartographic data for the negotiations. \nIn 1897 Jovan Cvijić published his map of Serbia and Montenegro in Vienna, which was used in the schools. The map is printed on a scale of 1: 750,000, and in the left corner one can find the map of Belgrade on a scale 1: 75,000. This map symbolises a great advancement in Serbian cartography and marked the beginning of a new era in Serbian cartography. \n\nJovan Cvijić was a honorary doctor of the Sorbonne University and the Charles University in Prague and a member of all major geographical societies in Europe at that time (Vienna, Paris, London, Prague, Budapest, Warsaw, Berlin etc.). He received several scientific prizes in the field of Geography. Jovan Cvijić died on 16 January 1927 in Belgrade.\n\n",

    "description": "Petar von Preradović (1818-1872) was born in Grabovnica (Military Frontier, today Croatia) on 19 March 1818 in the Orthodox Serbian family of Jovan and Pelagija Preradović and was baptised in the Serbian Orthodox Church in Mala Trešnjevica (Military Frontier, today Croatia) three days later. Next to this church were buried Preradović's parents. However, Petar von Preradović himself converted later to Roman Catholicism and declared himself as a Croat. Therefore, we still encounter an ongoing discussion in Serbian and Croatian historiography on his identity. Petar von Preradović started his military education at the Theresian Military Academy (\"Theresianische Militärakademie\") in Wiener Neustadt from 1830 to 1838. He was ennobled in 1864 and was promoted to Major General in 1866. Petar von Preradović was also a poet, who was very popular at this time.
