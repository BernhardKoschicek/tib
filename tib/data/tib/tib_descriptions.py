The area covered by TIB 1 was, according to the administrative structure of Greece, essentially divided into the following administrative districts: a) in Hellas, the Nomoi Eurytania, Phthiotis, Phokis and the island of Euboea, as well as Attica and the mainland parts of Corinthia, which have been assigned to the region of Sterea Ellada since the administrative reform of 2011; b) in Thessalia, Larisa, Trikala, Karditsa and Magnesia.
Today, the entire area of TIB 1 has a warm Mediterranean climate with increasing temperatures and decreasing precipitation from north to south. However, the inland areas, partly surrounded by mountains, are characterized by greater temperature amplitudes (especially higher winter cold) and heavier precipitation than the east coast. The wind wealth of the islands of the Aegean is also affected between May and September by constantly blowing, strong N and NE winds (Etesia, Greek meltémi), which contribute to strong drying out; this is, however, compensated for by higher precipitation on some islands.The subject of Hellas (military province), which at the beginning, end of the 7th century, was formed by the Peloponnesus and the Peloponnese. By the beginning of the 10th century, it was limited to Attica, the Megaris, Boeotia with the offshore island of Euboea, the Phocis, the islands of the Northern Sporades (Skiathos, Skopelos, Halonnesos, and the tributary islands), and the islands in the Saronic Gulf. The borders were formed by the mountains of Agrapha and Othrys to the north, the northern and southern gulfs of Euboea and the northern Aegean (TIB 10) to the northeast, the Saronic Gulf and the Gulf of Corinth to the south, and the Pindos Mountains and their southern foothills to the west, towards Aitolia and the south of Epirus (TIB 3).
The northernmost part of Hellas was formed by the wide Spercheios depression, named after the river of the same name (centers Zetunion/Lamia and Neai Patrai), which extends in a W-E direction and merges with the Malian Gulf.Southward, the region is bounded by several mountain ranges (in theEast Kallidromon with the bottleneck of Thermopylae,then Oite and others). The eastern central Greece is divided NW-SE by the Boeotian Kephissos (with short tributaries), which rises in the Oite Mountains and flows into Lake Kopais (which was drained by Katabothren in the Middle Ages and dried up in the 19th century). A further structuring results from small basin landscapes, each separated by low ridges; in two eastern ones are the drainless lakes Hylike and Paralimne. The centers of eastern central Greece were Boeotian Thebes and Chalkis, the capital of the island of Euboea, which here approaches Boeotia to within 40 m. This second largest island of Greece (about 3,580 km2) is largely mountainous, reaching 1,743 m in the Dirphys and 1,400 m in the Oche. The north and central parts of the island are fertile, with the coastal plains facing the mainland, while in the barren, predominantly mountainous south, only the plain around the port of Karystos, near the southwest coast, is suitable for agriculture.
The southern boundary of eastern central Greece against Attica and the Megaris is formed by the mountain ranges of Kithairon (where the Boeotian Asopos rises and flows into the Gulf of Euboea), Pastra and Parnes, which rise up to 1,400 meters. The Megaris (main town Megara) was highly impassable due to its mountainous character, which made the land route between Athens and the Corinth Strait difficult. Apart from the plains of Eleusis, Athens and Marathon, Attica can also be described as mountainous: the fertile hill country of the Mesogeia ("inland") up to Cape Sunion is bordered or interspersed by the mountains Parnes, Pentelikon, Hymettos, Laureotic Olympus and their foothills.

In addition to the theme of Hellas, TIB 1 also dealt with the eparchia Thessalia, which belongs to the theme of Macedonia and whose core is formed by the Thessalian plain, a closed basin landscape surrounded by mountains on all sides. To the west is the Pindos range, part of the Dinaric mountain system, with peaks up to 2,300 meters high. This mountain range, which begins in Dalmatia, continues in the Peloponnese in the Taygetos and continues through the Atabyros in Rhodes to Mount Solyma (Tahtalı Dağı) in Lycia. In the area of the Katara Pass, the most important passage from Thessaly into the neighboring Ēpeiros, the Pindos meets a loosely structured mountain range, which reaches the mountain massif of Mount Olympus in an easterly or northeasterly direction. Through this mountain range a road leads from Trikala to Grebena in Macedonia and another one from Larisa via Elassōn and the Stena Petrasin the valley of Haliakmōn in Macedonia. Thessaly is separated from the Macedonian Olympus by the Tempē Gorge. South of it, the eastern Thessalian mountains with Ossa (Byzantine Kissabos) and Pēlion extend into the Magnēsia peninsula, which largely closes off the Thessalian plain from the sea. In the Pagasitic Gulf between Magnēsia and the Thessalian plain, however, Thessaly also had access to the sea with the two important ports of Dēmētrias (near modern Volos) and Halmyros. To the south, the Thessalian Plain was separated by the Othrys Mountains from the landscape of Phthiotis, which lay to the south of them on the Maliakos Kolpos (Gulf of Lamia).Through the western foothills of the Othrys, the important pass road led from Lamia (Zētunion) to the Thessalian Plain.
Below the Maurobuni Mountains, between Ossa and Pēlion, lay the now dry Lake Boibē, and on the pass from Lamia through the Othrys, the also dry Lake Ezeros (Slavic "lake"). From west to east, the Thessalian plain was crossed by Pēneios; on it lie the two important cities of Trikala and Larisa. Northeast of Larisa, the river breaks through the foothills of Olympos (Katō Olympos)in theTempē Gorge, separating it from the adjacent Ossa Mountains.
The Thessalian plain is broken by the Middle Thessalian sill, which runs southeast from Titanos to the Chalkodonion Oros at Pherai (Belestinon). It separates the smaller western Thessalian plain with Trikala from the larger eastern Thessalian plain with Larisa.
The Magnēsia peninsula with the Pēlion Mountains, located to the east and facing the sea, is a landscape in its own right, with lush, wooded vegetation that contrasts significantly with the dry, woodless Thessalian plain. It offered ideal living conditions for monastic communities and was therefore called Kellia in the Middle Ages. Even today there are the monasteries of Makrinitsa and Nea Petra. The monks found much harsher living conditions on the steep Meteōra rocks of Stagoi (Kalampaka) in the upper Pēneios valley north of Trikala.

The area of Cappadocia, which stretched from the Great Salt Lake (Tatta Limnē, Tuz Gölü) in the west to the Euphrates in the east with the important legionary camp of Melitēnē,separated from Cilicia in the south by the Tauros River and from Pontus in the north by the Pontic Rim Mountains,was distributed in Byzantine times among the subjects ofCappadokia, Charsianon, Sebasteia and Lykandos. Two of the army assembly points (Aplēkta) in Anatolia were located inCappadocia: Kolōneia (Aksaray) and Kaisareia (Kayseri),likewise two of the stations of the chain of fire fromTauros to Cappadocia: Lulon and the station at Argaios(Hasan Dağı, here of the same name as Erciyes Dağı). The original location of CharsianonKastron in the Muşalim Kalesi, west of Sebasteia(Sivas), which was considered certain, was invalidated by the mention of the Kale Harsanosam Halys (Kızılırmak) northwest of Kaisareia in Ottoman tax registers-the exact locationmay perhaps be determined by new research in this area.
Cappadocia was served by a dense road network, including the important NW-SE diagonal connection from Byzantium to Antiocheia, which was also a pilgrimage route to Jerusalem. The bishoprics of the Church Fathers Gregory of Nyssa (Harmandalı) and Gregory of Nazianzus (Nenezi) were also stations on this road, as was Andabalis (Eski Andaval) with the now collapsed basilica of Constantine. Kaisareia, the episcopal city of the church fatherBasileios, was an important station of a W-O connection to Melitēnē, the legionary city on the Euphrates limes. At Kaisareia, it intersected with the most important N-S connection through Cappadocia coming from Amisos (Samsun) and joined the pilgrim road at Andabalis, with which it crossed the Tauros in the Cilician Gate (Pylai Kilikiai, GülekBoğazı, today no longer recognizable as a bottleneck after the construction of a highway) south of Tyana (today Kemerhisar).
On the western border of Cappadocia, at the edge of the Lycaonian salt steppe, about 950 m high, rises the 3,268 m high volcanic cone of Hasan Dağı, which, like the volcanic cone of Erciyes Dağı (with a height of 3,916 m also the highest mountain in Asia Minor) 120 km to the northeast, was called Argaios in Byzantine times. Between these two volcanoes, a landscape was formed by the soft tuff formed from the volcanic ash. On the one hand, erosion from wind and water formed small and large rock cones from which entire settlements, churches and monasteries were hollowed out. In the churches of Göreme and Ürgüp, as well as in the deep gorge of Peristremma, the richest fresco cycles from the Byzantine period in Asia Minor have been preserved. During the Byzantine defensive battles against the Arabs from the 7th to the 10th century, the invaded inhabitants found shelter in countless underground cities up to eight stories deep, such as Kaymaklı and Derinkuyu. The volcanic soil provided rich nutrients for agriculture, horticulture and even viticulture at an altitude of 1,200 meters.
At the foot of Erciyes Dağı, Kaisareia(Kayseri) is located at an altitude of 1,050 meters. The Cappadocian highlands rose to almost 1,300 meters in the north near Sivas, but fall again to 950 meters in the east in the Euphrates Valley near Malatya. Between Kayseriand Malatya lies an undulating hill country, from which in several mountain ranges, such as the Tahtalı Dağları and BinboğaDağları, the Antitauros moves southward. Nestled in theAntitauros is the plain of Elbistan (Elbistan Ovası)as the central settlement area with Lykandos, the suburb ofThema Lykandos.
Tephrikē (Divriği), in the 9th century center of the sect of the Paulikians, like the Arabs fierce opponents of the Byzantines, is embedded in the eastern Cappadocian mountains, through which the Euphrates makes its way south in a spectacular gorge.
The area between Kaisareia and Melitēnē, whose settlements had been largely abandoned in the defensive battles against the Arabs, became a "desert" (erēmia) called Symposion, centered in Kaleköy, a walled late antique settlement. Further to the southwest, the fortress of Tzamandos was built as a bulwark against the Arabs on a prominent, steep rock cone.
In the northeast of Cappadocia rises the Halys (Kızılırmak), with 1,355 km the longest river in Asia Minor, which after Sivas turns south and flows in a large arc through western Cappadocia, finally turning north and flowing into the Black Sea between Sinopē and Amisos.
Two other large rivers rise in the Antitauros and flow into the Mediterranean Sea in Cilicia. Near Tzamandos, the Saros (Seyhan) rises, which in this section is still called Zamantı Su, but in Byzantine times it was called Onopniktēs. Its eastern branch (Göksu) flows through Komana (Şarköy), the center of an ancient temple state of the goddess Ma. The Pyramos (Ceyhan) rises in the Elbistan Ovası and then flows through the basin of Kukusos (Göksun, the place of exile of John Chrysostom) to Cilicia and there through Mopsuestia (Misis, today Yakapınar) to flow into Aigaiai (Lajazzo, Yumurtalık).

Epirus, Greek Epeiros, has been the name for large parts of western mainland Greece and Albania since ancient times. It corresponds to about two-thirds of the current Albanian "qarqe" of Vlora and Gjirokastra and the Greek nomoi of Iōannina, Thesprōtia (capital Ēgumenitsa), Arta and Prebeza, often including the adjoining southern regions of Acarnania and Aetolia, which are grouped together in the nomos of A itōlia and A karnania (capital A grinion). In Roman and early Byzantine times, the border between the Palaia Epeiros and Nea Epeiros studied inTIB 3 ran north of the present-day Greek-Albanian border. In the Middle Byzantine period, Old Epirus corresponded essentially to the Nicopolis theme, while the Ionian Islands corresponded to the Kephallēnia theme. In the ecclesiastical administration, the islands of Kerkyra and Leukas were included in Epirus, whose center was Naupaktos, which replaced Nicopolis. The islands of Kephallēnia and Zakynthos, further south, belonged to the Peloponnese (Corinthos).
Epirus is a mountainous country. The main direction of the mountain ranges, such as Pindos, which forms the eastern border with Macedonia, is NNW-SE, parallel to the coast. To the north rise the mighty mountain ranges of Gramos (2,521 m) and Smolikas (2,631 m), which consists mainly of serpentine rocks. Epirus is virtually sealed off from Thessaly and southern Macedonia. In the southern part, in Aitolōakarnania, the mountains run rather in N-S direction. The predominantly mountainous structure of the entire region results in a subdivision into many mostly small landscape units. The mountainous character and the difficult transition between the partly parallel valleys of the rivers north of Iōannina - Sarantaporos, Aōos (Boosēs,Vjosa), Boïdomatēs, Drinos and Kalamas (Thyamis) - allow only little communication with neighboring regions. In the mountainous regions, nomadic livestock breeding, often combined with the alternation of summer and winter grazing, plays a greater role than agriculture.
The center of inner Epirus is the basin of Iōannina (about 480 m above sea level), an elongated karst basin (polje) with alluvial soils, formerly with two lakes without surface outflow; the town of Iōannina is located on the western shore of the larger lake. To the northeast and east of the basin rise the important headwaters of the Arachthos (Artas potamos), which flows south into the Ambracian Gulf. South of Iōannina, the Luros (Bubos, Byros, Rogōn potamos), which like the Arachthos flows into the Ambracian Gulf, has its source. Southwest of the city and west of the Tomaros/Olytsikas (1,971 m), the holy mountain of Dodona, the rivers Tyria and Acherōn have their source. They flow almost in the same valley furrow, the former to the north to Kalamas, the Acherōn, however, first to the south, and then, after the Orē Suliu and the Orē Paramythias have flowed around it, to take up the Kōkytos in the coastal lowlands.
In the south, the area around the Ambracian Gulf is largely characterized by the alluvial soil of the rivers. In the vicinity of Arta, the combination of alluvial deposits from the Luros and Arachthos rivers with the tectonic uplift of the Prebeza Peninsula, formed by clayey sands, has significantly altered the landscape in historical times and shifted the coastline far to the south, so that in many cases the current landscape differs greatly from the medieval one. Adjacent to the Ambracian Gulf to the south are the landscapes of Acarnania and Aetolia. Immediately south of the Gulf is High Acarnania, which consists of parallel bare limestone chains interspersed with narrow flysch zones in the longitudinal valleys. In central Acarnania, the heights decrease sharply and the land becomes narrower as the coastline recedes into bays from the west; in the south, Acarnania ends in the estuarine plain of the Achelōos, a sunken landscape filled in by the alluvium of the river. The Aetolian-Acarnanian Basin in Greater Agrinion, the most important cultural landscape of Aetolia, is a tectonic depression that continues to the north east of the mountains of Acarnania with the furrow of Lake Ribiu or Ambrakia to the southeast of the Ambrakian Gulf, and to the south, partly flowed by the Achelōos, to the lagoons of Aitōlikon and Mesolongion. Limestone formations are found north of Mesolongion in the Kleisura and particularly impressive in the mountains Barasoba (914 m) and Klokoba (1,038 m), which rise on the northern shore of the Gulf of Patras east of the delta of the river Euēnos (Ophidarēs). Not far to the east, already on the northern shore of the Gulf of Corinth, lies Naupaktos, which became the capital of the region after the end of Nicopolis.
The western Greek islands, called "Ionian islands" only in modern times after the name of the sea (Ionion pelagos, Ionium mare), which has been in use since ancient times, are arranged parallel to the direction of the mountain ranges of the nearby mainland in a north-northwest-southeast direction. Apart from the six main islands of Kerkyra, Paxoi, Leukas, Ithakē, Kephallēnia and Zakynthos, there are several secondary islands, especially southeast of Leukas. The mighty limestone block of Pantokratōr (906 m) in the north of Kerkyra (585 km2) is the continuation of the mountainous zones in the northwest of Epirus, otherwise Kerkyra has mainly alluvial land or fertile plains and hills built up in the Late Tertiary. The straits to the north and south of Kerkyra create almost a small inland sea between the island and the mainland.
The two islands of Paxoi (20 km2) and Antipaxoi (4 km2), consisting mainly of low limestone mountains, are not geologically the continuation of Kerkyra, but belong to a mountainous zone further west, which continues in Leukas, in the west of Kephallēnia and in Zakynthos. Leukas (about 300 km2), the closest member of the row of western Greek islands, is separated from the Acarnanian mainland only by a 6 km long shallow strait.The island is crossed from north to south by a mountainous zone (1,158 m) consisting mainly of limestones.South of Leukas, Ithakē (about 90 km2) extends for more than 20 km parallel to the northern peninsula of Kephallēnia. By far the largest part of the island consists of limestone mountains and is barren. Mōlos Bay on the eastern side of Ithakē narrows the island to a strip of land about 600 m wide. Kephallēnia (750 km2), the largest of the Ionian islands, is crisscrossed by limestone mountains, the central mountain range of which rises to 1,628 m in the south with the Ainos Mountains. The calcareous landscape of Atheras and the fertile peninsula of Palikē adjoin the core of the island with the Libathō cultural landscape to the west, while the peninsula of Erisos, occupied by a calcareous plateau, rises to the north. 15 km south of Kephallēnia and only a little further west of the Peloponnese lies Zakynthos (about 400 km2), the southernmost of the western Greek islands. Three zones run through the island from northwest to southeast: two-thirds of the island is covered by limestone mountains (750 m) with a karst plateau; to the east, a plain of alluvium joins the mountainous land, reaching the coasts in the north and south and merging into a chain of hills in the southeast.

The early Byzantine provinces of Galatia I, Galatia II (= Galatia Salutaris or Salutaria) and Lykaonia occupy a large area around the capital of the Turkish Republic, Ankara, in the north and around the important regional center of Konya in the south. Thus, they encompass the western part of the so-called Central Anatolian Highlands and strips of the surrounding mountainous areas. In the north, both Galatian provinces have a small part of the southern slope of the North Anatolian (Pontic) Rim Mountains, which form a barrier between the Central Anatolian Highlands and the Black Sea, consisting of several W-E directed mountain ranges. In the southwest Lycaonia reaches the chains of the (Pisidian) Taurus, in the south even to the ridges of this mountain range, which here forms the border with Isauria and generally separates the Central Anatolian Highlands from the Mediterranean area.A mountainous area (parts of the so-called Inner West Anatolian Sill) forms the western border of Galatia. To the east, the transition from Galatia and Lycaonia to Cappadocia is less noticeable, but the Central Anatolian Highlands continue, albeit gradually rising and characterized by more pronounced mountain relief. Farther to the south, however, the eastern border of Lycaonia directly abuts the 3,268 m high volcanic cone of Argaios/HasanDağ.
The capital of Lycaonia, Ikonion/Konya, is located in the far west of the province near the border with Pisidia, and thus also on the western edge of the Central Anatolian Highlands. In the southwest, Lycaonia has a small share of the West Taurian Lake District; Lycaonian are the southeast end of the Pusgusē Limne/Beyşehir Gölü (here the important city of Mistheia) and the southeast TrōgitisLimnē/Suğla Gölü, a karst lake that had changing water levels in the past, was completely drained around the turn of the last millennium, and has since been restored as an artificial water basin. This development can be followed on historical Google Earth images from 1984 to 2016. The chains of the Taurus, which strike here predominantly in a northwest-southeast direction, merge southeast of the Trōgitis Limnē into W-O directed mountain ranges, which accompany Lycaonia in the south to the Cappadocian border.
The central areas of Lycaonia extend, as mentioned, on the flat or slightly undulating, extensive plateaus of the Central Anatolian Highlands (altitude around 1,000 m), which have a pronounced steppe character and belong, for the most part, to the drainageless areas of central Asia Minor. The high altitude and the mountainous surroundings result in an extremely dry climate, hot in summer and cold in winter. Precipitation is almost always less than 400 mm (less than 200 mm in the Tatta Limnē/Tuz Gölü depression), so that - with the exception of the peripheral areas, which receive some water from the mountains - the highlands, which were already described in ancient times as axylos "woodless or forestless," were almost exclusively used for sheep breeding. Only modern wheat varieties, which require very little water, have made it possible to grow cereals here as well. Nevertheless, large areas are still covered with typical steppe plants, including Artemisia species, thorn pads, thistles, mullein and various steppe grasses; around Tuz Gölü, the "Artemisia steppe", which is particularly suitable for sheep pastures, predominates.
The Konya Ovası (Konya Plain) extends from Konya only a little to the north and east; it mainly extends to the south and especially to the southeast to the Cappadocian border near Ereğli. In the south, the volcanic Kara Dağ(2,271 m) rises steeply from the plain, with two main peaks fortified already in Hellenistic and again in Byzantine times, and several lower peaks. Several early Byzantine settlements with numerous churches (the famous Binbir Kilise "1001 churches") indicate it as an important settlement center. To the northeast of Kara Dağ, another volcanic mountain rises from the Lycaonian plain, the elongated Karaca Dağ, also a center of ancient and early Byzantine settlement. Low ridges, most notably Boz Dağ, over 1,700 m high, separate the Konya Ovası from another, even larger depression, which adjoins the Konya Ovası to the northeast. The deepest depression of this area is in the northeast and is occupied by the Great Salt Lake (Turkish Tuz Gölü, ancient TattaLimnē, 905 m above sea level). Tuz Gölü owes its high salt content (about 33%) to the saline soil, so that the lake is surrounded by extensive salt steppes, especially in the south and southeast.
To the north and northwest of Lycaonia is Galatia. The larger Galatia I initially advances northward in the form of a "narrow stem" between Galatia II (Salutaris) and Cappadocia, then spreads "mushroom-shaped" eastward (to Tabia) toward the province of Helenopontos and westward toward Bithynia.In the "narrow stem" the landscape character changes little at first, the central Anatolian steppe character remains predominant. However, most of it no longer belongs to the drainless area, it is drained to the Halys/Kızılırmak, the most important stream of central Asia Minor. Towards the north, around Ankyra/Ankara, the capital of Galatia I and today of the Turkish Republic, the inner-Anatolian steppe land increasingly interlocks with mountain ranges, which already belong to the system of theNordanatolian Marginal Mountains and thus cause a mixed landscape character. Steppe areas are already interrupted by mountain ranges often covered with dry forests. The widening of the area of Galatia I to the east - here, too, the central Anatolian character prevails - is intersected by two rivers flowing to the north, the aforementioned Halys/Kızılırmak, which flows in a wide valley, and the Delice Irmak, an important southern tributary of the Halys. To the west, however, the landscape character of Galatia I changes more, as here the maritime influences of both the Black Sea and the Marmara Sea are felt. The central axis of this area is the valley of the second largest river in the region, the Sangario/Sakarya Nehri, which is often very narrow and dammed over long stretches. It is bordered to the south by the Dağları sinuses and to the north by individual mountain ranges separated by deeply incised river valleys.
Galatia II, or Salutaris, joins the "narrow stem" or western extension of Galatia I to the west and south. In the south, it borders on the province of Pisidia, which is far to the east, and in the southwest and west on Phrygia II or Salutaris/Salutaria.Galatia II is crossed by two major rivers, the Tembris/Porsuk Çayı, which flows from west to east toward the Sangarios/Sakarya Nehri, and, in the south and in the central area of the province, the Sangariosself. The Sangarios flows through the province first in a southeasterly direction, then circles the southeastern fall of the Sivrihisar Dağları and continues its course in a northerly direction until it reaches the border of Galatia I. The Sangarios is an almost bare mountain mass. This almost bare mountain range, whose highest peak (1,820 m above sea level), crowned by a Byzantine castle, is called Dindymon, advances from northwest to southeast. On its southern slope lies the provincial capital of Galatia II, Pessinus/Ballıhisar. After a wide depression formed by the upper reaches of the Sangario, the Emir Dağları (up to 2,295 m above sea level), where again western Anatolian influences are noticeable, and the adjoining Gölcük Dağı to the east form the southern border of the province. The borders to Pisidia, Lycaonia and to the "style" Galatia I are already in the central Anatolian steppe area.
