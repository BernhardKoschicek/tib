"Athens in the same year. Since 1976 the aforesaid volume has served as a "

#: tib/templates/tib/history/history.html:128

"Thus, the TIB carries out systematic research of the historical geography"
" of the Byzantine Empire, which existed from the beginning of the 4th "
"century AD until the 15th century AD, that is from Late Antiquity to the "
"Ottoman conquest, in order to create an atlas of the aforesaid empire. "
"The results of each TIB volume are presented to the reader on a map on "
"the scale of 1:800,000 with the headwords marked onto it. Special symbols"
" and combinations of colours indicate the nature of the monument and its "
"dating. The maps also include historical places for whose existence there"
" is only archaeological evidence without knowledge of their ancient "
"(Byzantine) names."
msgstr ""

#: tib/templates/tib/history/history.html:151
msgid ""
"The original plan to produce maps on the scale of 1:1,000,000 in the "
"style of the Tabula Imperii Romani (see above) had soon been abandoned "
"and the former Institute of Cartography of the Austrian Academy of "
"Sciences designed a map for the whole Mediterranean on the above-"
"mentioned larger scale. This enabled a more thorough topographic approach"
" and facilitated the entry of headwords. If necessary, even a larger "
"scale is applied for some regions (e.g. 1:400,000). The scholarly work of"
" the TIB focuses on the regions / provinces of the Byzantine Empire. "
"Therefore, borders had to be drawn for each volume at the beginning of "
"the project in accordance with the sources on Byzantine administration "
"and the natural borders of landscapes. This classification was undertaken"
" by Johannes Koder."
