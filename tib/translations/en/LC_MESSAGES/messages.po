"Individual regions are represented on maps on a scale of 1 : 800,000. A "
"separate accompanying volume provides the results of further research in each "
"region. Each volume contains detailed introductory chapters on geography and "
"climate, borders and territorial designations, history, administrative "
"history, church history and monasticism, traffic routes, economy and "
"demographic trends. The main part of each volume consists of an alphabetical "
"catalogue of all toponyms, hydronyms etc. that were known in Byzantine times. "
"Also included are the historical places, whose historical names are unknown, "
"but for whose existence there is (or there was) archaeological evidence. "
"Written sources (from Late Antiquity to Early Modern Times) and archaeological "
"materials elucidate the history of individual places, along with brief "
"descriptions of monuments, both those that are known to have existed and those "
"that are still preserved. The aforesaid results are enriched by systematic "
"field research in order to verify, modify or complete the information of the "
