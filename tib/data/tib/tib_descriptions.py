        _l('In accordance with the administrative structure of Greece, the area covered by TIB 1 was essentially divided into the following administrative districts: a) in Hellas, the Nomoi Eurytania, Phthiotis, Phokis and the island of Euboea, which have been assigned to the Sterea Ellada region since the 2011 administrative reform, as well as Attica and the mainland parts of Corinthia; b) in Thessalia, Larisa, Trikala, Karditsa and Magnesia.'),
        _l('Today, the entire area of TIB 1 largely has a warm temperate Mediterranean climate with temperatures increasing from north to south and precipitation decreasing. However, the inland areas, partly enclosed by mountains, are characterised by greater temperature amplitudes (especially higher winter cold) and heavier precipitation than the east coast. The windiness of the Aegean islands is also affected between May and September by steadily blowing, strong N and N winds (Etesia, Greek: meltémi), which contribute to severe desiccation; however, this is compensated for by higher precipitation on some islands.'),
        _l('The subject of Hellas (military province), which initially, at the end of the 7th century, extended from the Peloponnese in the south to Mount Olympus and the Tempe Valley in the north, was by the beginning of the 10th century limited to Attica, the Megaris, Boeotia with the offshore island of Euboea, the Phocis, the islands of the Northern Sporades (Skiathos, Skopelos, Halonnesos and tributary islands) and the islands in the Saronic Gulf. The borders were now formed to the north, towards Thessalia, by the mountains of Agrapha and Othrys, to the north-east by the northern and southern gulfs of Euboea and the northern Aegean (TIB 10), to the south by the Saronic Gulf and the Gulf of Corinth, and to the west, towards Aitolia and the south of Epirus (TIB 3), by the Pindos Mountains and their southern foothills.'),
        _l('The northernmost part of Hellas was formed by the wide Spercheios depression, named after the river of the same name (centres Zetunion/Lamia and Neai Patrai), which extends in a W- E direction and merges with the Malian Gulf. To the south, the region is bordered by several mountain ranges (in the east Kallidromon with the Thermopylae bottleneck, then Oite and others). The adjoining eastern central Greece to the south is divided NW-SE by the Boeotian Kephissos (with short tributaries), which rises in the Oite Mountains and flows into Lake Kopais (which was drained by Katabothren in the Middle Ages and has dried up since the 19th century). Further structuring results from small basin landscapes, each separated by low ridges; two eastern ones contain the drainless lakes Hylike and Paralimne. The centres of eastern central Greece were Boeotian Thebes and Chalkis, the capital of the island of Euboea, which here comes within 40 m of Boeotia. This second largest island in Greece (approx. 3,580 km2) is largely mountainous, reaching 1,743 m in the Dirphys and 1,400 m in the Oche. Fertile areas are the north of the island and Centraluboea with the coastal plains facing the mainland, while in the barren, predominantly mountainous south only the plain near the southwest coast around the port city of Karystos allows agriculture.'),
        _l('The southern boundary of eastern central Greece against Attica and the Megaris is formed by the mountain ranges of Kithairon (where the Boeotian Asopos rises, flowing into the Gulf of Euboea), Pastra and Parnes, which rise up to 1,400 metres. The Megaris (main town Megara) was highly impassable due to its mountainous character, which made the land route between Athens and the Strait of Corinth difficult. Apart from the plains of Eleusis, Athens and Marathon, Attica can also be described as mountainous: the fertile hill country of the Mesogeia ("inland") up to Cape Sunion is bordered or interspersed by the mountains of Parnes, Pentelikon, Hymettos, Laureotic Olympus and their foothills.'),

        _l('The territory of Cappadocia, which stretched from the Great Salt Lake (Tatta Limnē, Tuz Gölü) in the west to the Euphrates in the east with the important legionary camp of Melitēnē, separated from Cilicia in the south by the Tauros and from Pontos in the north by the Pontic Rim Mountains, was distributed in Byzantine times among the subjects of Cappadokia, Charsianon, Sebasteia and Lykandos. Two of the army assembly points (Aplēkta) in Anatolia were located in Cappadocia: Kolōneia (Aksaray) and Kaisareia (Kayseri), likewise two of the stations of the chain of fire from the Tauros to Cappadocia: Lulon and the station at Argaios (Hasan Dağı, here of the same name as Erciyes Dağı). The location of Charsianon Kastron in the Muşalim Kalesi, west of Sebasteia (Sivas), which was originally considered certain, was rendered obsolete by the mention of the Kale Harsanos on the Halys (Kızılırmak) northwest of Kaisareia in Ottoman tax registers - the exact location could perhaps be opened up by new research in this area.'),
        _l('Cappadocia was served by a dense road network, including the important NW-SE diagonal connection from Byzantium to Antiocheia, also a pilgrimage route to Jerusalem. The bishoprics of the Church Fathers Gregory of Nyssa (Harmandalı) and Gregory of Nazianzus (Nenezi) were also stations on this road, as was Andabalis (Eski Andaval) with the now collapsed basilica of Constantine. Kaisareia, the bishop\'s town of the church father Basileios, was an important station on a W-O connection to Melitēnē, the legionary city on the Euphrates Limes. In Kaisareia, this crossed the most important N-S connection through Cappadocia coming from Amisos (Samsun) and joined the pilgrim road at Andabalis, with which it jointly overcame the Tauros in the Cilician Gate (Pylai Kilikiai, Gülek Boğazı, today no longer recognisable as a bottleneck after the construction of a highway) south of Tyana (today Kemerhisar).'),
        _l('On the western border of Cappadocia, the 3,268 m high volcanic cone of Hasan Dağı rises at the edge of the approximately 950 m high Lycaonian salt steppe. Like the volcanic cone of Erciyes Dağı, which is 120 km further to the north-east (at 3,916 m, it is also the highest mountain in Asia Minor), it was called Argaios in Byzantine times. Between these two volcanoes, a landscape was formed by the soft tuff formed from the volcanic ash. On the one hand, erosion from wind and water formed small and large rock cones from which entire settlements, churches and monasteries were hollowed out. In the churches of Göreme and Ürgüp and in the deep gorge of the Peristremma, the richest fresco cycles from the Byzantine period in Asia Minor have been preserved. During the Byzantine defensive battles against the Arabs from the 7th to the 10th century, the invaded inhabitants found shelter in countless underground cities up to eight storeys deep, such as in Kaymaklı and Derinkuyu. The volcanic soil provided ample nutrients for agriculture, horticulture and even viticulture at an altitude of 1,200 metres.'),
        _l('At the foot of Erciyes Dağı, Kaisareia (Kayseri) is located at an altitude of 1,050 metres. The Cappadocian highlands rose to an altitude of almost 1,300 m in the north near Sivas, but fall again to 950 m in the east in the Euphrates valley near Malatya. Between Kayseri and Malatya lies an undulating hill country from which the Antitauros rises to the south in several mountain ranges, such as the Tahtalı Dağları and Binboğa Dağları. Nestled in the Antitauros is the plain of Elbistan (Elbistan Ovası) as the central settlement area with Lykandos, the suburb of the subject Lykandos.'),
        _l('Nestled in the eastern Cappadocian mountains, through which the Euphrates makes its way south in a spectacular gorge, lies Tephrikē (Divriği), in the 9th century the centre of the Paulikian sect, like the Arabs fierce opponents of the Byzantines.'),
        _l('The area between Kaisareia and Melitēnē, whose settlements had been largely abandoned in the defensive battles against the Arabs, became a "desert" (erēmia) with the name Symposion, whose centre lay in Kaleköy, a late antique settlement surrounded by a defensive wall. Further southwest, the fortress of Tzamandos was built on a prominent, steep rock cone as a bulwark against the Arabs.'),
        _l('In the north-east of Cappadocia rises the Halys (Kızılırmak), at 1,355 km the longest river in Asia Minor, which turns south after Sivas and flows in a large curve through western Cappadocia, finally turning north and flowing into the Black Sea between Sinopē and Amisos.'),
        _l('Two other large rivers rise in the Antitauros and flow into the Mediterranean in Cilicia. Near Tzamandos, the Saros (Seyhan) rises, which in this section still bears the name Zamantı Su today, but was called Onopniktēs in Byzantine times. Its eastern source (Göksu) flows through Komana (Şarköy), the centre of an ancient temple state of the goddess Ma. The Pyramos (Ceyhan) rises in the Elbistan Ovası, which then flows through the basin of Kukusos (Göksun, place of exile of John Chrysostom) to Cilicia and there through Mopsuestia (Misis, today Yakapınar) to flow out at Aigaiai (Lajazzo, Yumurtalık).'),

        _l('Epirus, Greek Epeiros, has been the name for large parts of western mainland Greece and Albania since ancient times. It corresponds to about two-thirds of the current Albanian "Qarqe" Vlora and Gjirokastra as well as the Greek nomoi Iōannina, Thesprōtia (capital Ēgumenitsa), Arta and Prebeza, often including the adjoining southern regions of Acarnania and Aetolia, which are grouped together in the nomos A itōlia and A karnania (capital A grinion). In Roman and early Byzantine times, the border between the Palaia Epeiros studied in TIB 3 and the Nea Epeiros ran north of the present Greek-Albanian border. In the Middle Byzantine period, Old Epirus essentially corresponded to the theme of Nicopolis, whereas the Jonian Islands corresponded to the theme of Kephallēnia. In ecclesiastical administration, the islands of Kerkyra and Leukas were counted as part of Epirus, with Naupaktos having taken the place of Nicopolis as its centre. The islands of Kephallēnia and Zakynthos further south, on the other hand, belonged to the Peloponnese (Corinthos).'),
        _l('Epirus is a mountainous country. The main strike direction of the mountain ranges, such as the Pindos Mountains, which form the eastern border towards Macedonia, is NNW-SE, thus parallel to the coast. To the north rise the mighty mountain ranges of Gramos (2,521 m) and Smolikas (2,631 m), which consists mainly of serpentine rocks. Epirus is virtually sealed off from Thessaly and southern Macedonia. In the southern part, in Aitolōakarnania, the mountains run more in a N-S direction. The predominantly mountainous structure of the entire region results in a subdivision into many mostly small landscape units. The mountainous character and the difficult transition between the partly parallel valleys of the rivers north of Iōannina - Sarantaporos, Aōos (Boosēs, Vjosa), Boïdomatēs, Drinos and Kalamas (Thyamis) - allow little communication with neighbouring regions. In the mountainous regions, nomadic livestock breeding, often combined with the alternation between summer and winter pasture, plays a greater role than agriculture.'),
        _l('The centre of inner Epirus is the basin of Iōannina (about 480 m above sea level), an elongated karst basin (polje) with alluvial soils, formerly with two lakes without surface outflow; the town of Iōannina lies on the western shore of the larger lake. To the northeast and east of the basin, respectively, rise the important headwaters of the Arachthos (Artas potamos), which flows south into the Ambracian Gulf. South of Iōannina, the Luros (Bubos, Byros, Rogōn potamos), which like the Arachthos flows into the Ambracian Gulf, has its source, and southwest of the city and west of the Tomaros/Olytsikas (1,971 m), the holy mountain of Dodona, the rivers Tyria and Acherōn rise. They flow almost in the same valley furrow, the former to the north to the Kalamas, the Acherōn, on the other hand, first to the south and then, after flowing around the Orē Suliu and the Orē Paramythias, to take up the Kōkytos already in the coastal lowlands.'),
        _l('In the south, the area around the Ambracian Gulf is largely characterised by the alluvium of the rivers. In the vicinity of Arta, the combination of alluvial action by the Luros and Arachthos rivers with the tectonic uplift of the Prebeza Peninsula, formed by clayey sands, has significantly altered the landscape in historical times and shifted the coastline far to the south, so that in many cases the current landscape differs greatly from the medieval one. Adjacent to the Ambracian Gulf to the south are the landscapes of Acarnania and Aetolia. Immediately south of the Gulf is High Acarnania. This consists of parallel bare limestone chains, between which there are narrow flysch zones in the longitudinal valleys. In Central Acarnania, the heights decrease sharply and the land becomes narrower due to bays indented from the west in the coastline; in the south, Acarnania ends in the estuarine plain of the Achelōos, a sunken landscape filled in by the alluvium of the river. The Aetolian-Acarnanian Basin in the Agrinion area, the most important cultural landscape of Aetolia, is a tectonic depression that continues to the north east of the mountains of Acarnania with the furrow of Lake Ribiu or Ambrakia to the southeast of the Ambrakian Gulf and to the south, partly flowed by the Achelōos, to the lagoons of Aitōlikon and Mesolongion. Limestone formations are found north of Mesolongion in the Kleisura and particularly impressive in the Barasoba (914 m) and Klokoba (1,038 m) mountains, which rise on the northern shore of the Gulf of Patras east of the delta of the river Euēnos (Ophidarēs). Not far to the east, already on the northern shore of the Gulf of Corinth, is Naupaktos, which became the capital of the region after the demise of Nicopolis.'),
        _l('The western Greek islands, only called the "Ionian Islands" in modern times after the name of the sea (Ionion pelagos, Ionium mare) which has been in use since antiquity, are arranged parallel to the strike of the mountain ranges of the nearby mainland in a north-northwest-south-southeast direction. Apart from the six main islands of Kerkyra, Paxoi, Leukas, Ithakē, Kephallēnia and Zakynthos, there are several secondary islands, especially south-east of Leukas. The mighty limestone block of Pantokratōr (906 m) in the north of Kerkyra (585 km2) is the continuation of the mountainous zones in the north-west of Epirus, otherwise Kerkyra is mainly made up of alluvial land or fertile plains and hilly land built up in the Late Tertiary period. The straits to the north and south of Kerkyra create almost a small inland sea between the island and the mainland.'),
        _l('The two islands of Paxoi (20 km2) and Antipaxoi (4 km2), consisting mainly of low limestone mountains, are not geologically the continuation of Kerkyra, but belong to a mountainous zone further west, which continues in Leukas, in the west of Kephallēnias and in Zakynthos. Leukas (about 300 km2), the next link in the western Greek island chain, is separated from the Acarnanian mainland only by a shallow strait 6 km long. The island is crossed from north to south by a mountainous zone consisting mainly of limestones (1,158 m). South of Leukas, Ithakē (about 90 km2) extends for more than 20 km parallel to the northern peninsula of Kephallēnia. By far the largest part of the island consists of limestone mountains and is barren. Mōlos Bay on the eastern side of Ithakē narrows the island to a strip of land about 600 m wide. Kephallēnia (750 km2), the largest of the Ionian Islands, is criss-crossed by limestone mountains, the central mountain range of which rises to 1,628 m in the south with the Ainos Mountains. The calcareous landscape of Atheras and the fertile Palikē peninsula adjoin the core of the island with the Libathō cultural landscape to the west, while the Erisos peninsula, which is occupied by a calcareous plateau, rises to the north. 15 km south of Kephallēnia and only a little further west of the Peloponnese lies Zakynthos (about 400 km2), the southernmost of the western Greek islands. Three zones run through the island from northwest to southeast: two-thirds of the island is occupied by limestone mountains (750 m) with a karstified plateau; to the east, a plain consisting of alluvial land adjoins the mountainous land, reaching the coasts in the north and south and merging into a chain of hills in the southeast.'),

        _l('The early Byzantine provinces of Galatia I, Galatia II (: Galatia Salutaris or Salutaria) and Lykaonia occupy the greater area around the capital of the Turkish Republic, Ankara, in the north and around the important regional centre of Konya in the south. They thus encompass the western part of the so-called Central Anatolian Highlands and strips of surrounding mountainous country. In the north, both Galatian provinces still have a small part of the southern slope of the North Anatolian (Pontic) Rim Mountains, which form a barrier between the Central Anatolian Highlands and the Black Sea consisting of several W-E directed mountain ranges. In the southwest, Lycaonia reaches up to the chains of the (Pisidian) Taurus, in the south even to the ridges of this mountain range, which here forms the border to Isauria and generally separates the Central Anatolian Highlands from the Mediterranean area. A mountainous area (parts of the so-called Inner West Anatolian Threshold) forms the western border of Galatia. To the east, the transition from Galatia and Lycaonia to Cappadocia is less noticeable, as the Central Anatolian Highlands continue, albeit gradually rising and characterised by more pronounced mountain relief. Further south, however, the eastern border of Lycaonia directly abuts the 3,268 m high volcanic cone of Argaios/Hasan Dağ.'),
        _l('The capital of Lycaonia, Ikonion/Konya, lies in the far west of the province near the border with Pisidia, and thus also on the western edge of the Central Anatolian Highlands. To the southwest, Lycaonia has a small share in the West Taurian Lake District; Lycaonian are the southeastern end of the Pusgusē Limne/Beyşehir Gölü (here the important town of Mistheia) and the southeastern Trōgitis Limnē/Suğla Gölü, a karst lake that had changing water levels in the past, was completely drained around the turn of the last millennium and has since been restored as an artificial water basin. This development can be followed on historical Google Earth images from 1984 to 2016. The chains of the Taurus, which strike here predominantly in a northwest-southeast direction, merge southeast of the Trōgitis Limnē into W-O directed mountain ranges that accompany Lycaonia in the south to the Cappadocian border.'),
        _l('The central spaces of Lycaonia extend, as mentioned, to the flat or slightly undulating, extensive plateaus of the Central Anatolian Highlands (sea level around 1,000 m), which have a pronounced steppe character and belong for the most part to the drainless areas of central Asia Minor. The high altitude and the mountainous surroundings result in an extremely dry climate, moderately hot in summer and cold in winter. Rainfall remains almost consistently below 400 mm (in the Tatta Limnē/Tuz Gölü depression below 200 mm), so that - with the exception of the peripheral areas that receive some water from the mountains - sheep farming has been practised almost exclusively in the highlands, which were already called axylos "woodless or forestless" in ancient times. Only modern varieties of wheat, which manage with very little water, make it possible to grow cereals here as well. Nevertheless, even today, large areas are covered with typical steppe plants, including Artemisia species, thorn pads, thistles, mullein and various steppe grasses; around Tuz Gölü, the "Artemisia steppe", particularly suitable for sheep pastures, predominates.'),
        _l('The Konya Ovası (plain or depression of Konya) extends from Konya only a little to the north and east; it mainly stretches to the south and especially to the southeast to the Cappadocian border near Ereğli. To the south, the volcanic Kara Dağ (2,271 m) rises steeply from the plain, with two main peaks already fortified in Hellenistic times and again in Byzantine times, and several lower peaks. Several early Byzantine settlements with numerous churches (the famous Binbir Kilise "1001 churches") indicate it as an important settlement centre. To the north-east of the Kara Dağ, another volcanic mountain rises from the Lycaonian plain, the elongated Karaca Dağ, also a centre of ancient and early Byzantine settlement. Low ranges of hills, most notably the Boz Dağ, over 1,700 m high, separate the Konya Ovası from another, even larger depression that joins the Konya Ovası to the northeast. The deepest depression of this area is found in the northeast and is occupied by the Great Salt Lake (Turkish Tuz Gölü, ancient Tatta Limnē, 905 m above sea level). Tuz Gölü owes its high salt content (approx. 33%) to the saline soil, so that the lake is surrounded by extensive salt steppes, especially in the south and southeast.'),
        _l('To the north and northwest of Lycaonia is Galatia. The larger Galatia I initially advances northwards in the form of a "narrow stem" between Galatia II (Salutaris) and Cappadocia, then spreads "mushroom-shaped" eastwards (as far as Tabia) towards the province of Helenopontos and westwards towards Bithynia. In the "narrow stem", the landscape character changes little at first, the central Anatolian steppe character remains predominant. However, most of it no longer belongs to the drainless area, it is drained to the Halys/ Kızılırmak, the most important stream of central Asia Minor. Towards the north, around Ankyra/Ankara, the capital of Galatia I and today of the Turkish Republic, the Inner Anatolian steppe land increasingly interlocks with mountain ranges that already belong to the system of the North Anatolian Rim Mountains, thus causing a mixed landscape character. Steppe areas are already interrupted by mountain ranges often covered with dry forests. The widening of the area of Galatia I to the east - here, too, the Central Anatolian character prevails - is intersected by two rivers flowing to the north, the aforementioned Halys/Kızılırmak, which flows in a wide valley, and the Delice Irmak, an important southern tributary of the Halys. To the west, on the other hand, the landscape character of Galatia I changes more, as here the maritime influences from both the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara become noticeable. The central axis of this area is formed by the valley of the second largest river in the region, the Sangario/Sakarya Nehri, which faces E-W, is often very narrow and is today dammed over long stretches, and is bordered to the south by the Dağları sinuses and to the north by individual mountain ranges separated by deeply incised river valleys.'),
        _l('Galatia II or Salutaris joins the "narrow stem" or western extension of Galatia I to the west and south. In the south it borders on the province of Pisidia, which here advanced far to the east, and in the southwest and west on Phrygia II or Salutaris/Salutaria. Galatia II is crossed by two major river courses, the Tembris/Porsuk Çayı, which flows from west to east towards the Sangarios/Sakarya Nehri, and, to the south and in the central area of the province, the Sangarios itself. The Sangarios first flows through the province in a southeasterly direction, then skirts the southeastern slope of the Sivrihisar Dağları and continues its course in a northerly direction to the Galatia I border. This almost bare mountain massif, whose highest peak (1,820 m above sea level) crowned by a Byzantine castle was called Dindymon, advances from northwest to southeast. On its southern slope lies the provincial capital of Galatia II, Pessinus/Ballıhisar. After a broad depression formed by the upper reaches of the Sangario, the Emir Dağları (up to 2,295 m above sea level), where again Western Anatolian influences are noticeable, and the adjoining Gölcük Dağı to the east form the southern border of the province.

In another large arc, the Tauros and Antitauros then enclosed the wide coastal plain of Kilikia Pedias up to the Amanos with the two Byzantine provinces of Kilikia I with the metropolis of Tarsos and Kilikia II with the metropolis of Anazarbos.'),

East of Ayaş, the river of the same name flows into Lamos (Limonlu), whose valley, cut deep into the karst landscape, also harbours numerous ancient and Byzantine settlements and is the origin of the monumental water conduit with rock tunnels and many aqueduct bridges to Korykos, renovated from ancient to early Byzantine times. On the banks of the Lamos, during the Byzantine-Arab wars, when the Kilikia Pedias was occupied by the Arabs, numerous armistice negotiations took place with subsequent exchange of prisoners. After Mersin, the plain widens and reaches Tarsos (also today Tarsus), the ancient capital of Cilicia I. Tarsus lies on the Kydnos, a river that rises in Cappadocia and flows through the Pylai Kilikiai (today canalised under the highway). Further east follows Adana, today the capital of the adjoining wide plain of the Çukurova, which is situated in the alluvial plain of the two large rivers Saros (Seyhan) and Pyramos (Ceyhan), is particularly fertile and today mainly used for cotton cultivation. The Saros rises in Cappadocia (TIB 2) and breaks through the Tauros in a narrow gorge near Faraşa (Byzantine Rodandos). In its lower course, it still receives tributaries that come from the high valley of Karsantı below the Ala Dağ. This was one of the centres of the Armenians expelled from High Armenia, who founded a kingdom of Armenia in Cilicia in the 11th-14th centuries. The first residence of the Rupenid dynasty was in Baka (Feke) in the Saros Valley, later in Lambrun (Çamlıyayla) in the foothills of the Tauros northwest of Tarsus. The following dynasty of the Hethumids resided a little further south in Paperon (Çandır). To the east of the Kilikia Pedias, between the Saros and the Pyramos (Ceyhan), lies Sision (Kozan), until 1375 the last of the Armenian residences. Between Kozan and Yakapınar (Misis, Mopsuestia), in Anazarbos, Metropolis of Kilikia II, east above the ancient and Byzantine city on a mighty rocky ridge, a fortress was built in Armenian times, with a wide view over the Kilikia Pedias. The Pyramos flows not far west of Aigaia (Lajazzo, Yumurtalık), the most important port of the Kingdom of Armenia, from which Marco Polo set out on his journey to China in 1275.

To the south, the main Balkan chain drops steeply to the basins of the Sub-Balkans. These basins are successive trench-like depressions from west to east (e.g. the Kazanlăk basin, through which the Tundža flows in an easterly direction). The zone of sub-Balkan basins is closed in the south by the low mountain range of Sredna gora, which consists of tectonically strongly pressed granite and of ancient crystalline and Mesozoic rocks. The southern slopes of the Sredna gora lead to the broad depression of the Upper Thracian Lowland, through which the Marica River flows and in which the metropolis of the province of Thrakē Philippupolis/Plovdiv is located; this continues to the east with the valley of the Middle Tundža and the lowlands around the Gulf of Burgas. The Upper Thracian Lowland merges with the Rodopē Mountains in the south. North-east of this, the lower Tundža valley rises towards the Black Sea to the Strandža Mountains (Turkish: İstranca), which continue the old crystalline Rodopē rocks. The Strandža Mountains are partly covered by Tertiary strata and are cut and divided by a network of rivers. To the south and southwest, the İstranca mountain range slopes gently down to the hills and valley basins of the Rēgina/Ergene River, which flows into the Marica north of İpsala. From the metropolis of the province of Haimimontos Adrianupolis/Edirne onwards, the Marica (Hebros, Meriç) flows in a southerly direction and marks the eastern boundary of the Rodopes. 15 km north of the mouth of the river (at the town of Ainos/Enez) was Traïanupolis, the metropolis of the province of Rodopē. The Rodopē Mountains, separated from the Rila and Pirin Mountains in the west by the depression of the Nestos/Mesta Valley, are a mountain mass about 250 km long and 100 km wide, gradually losing height towards the east. Wide, weakly undulating plateaus predominate, with deep valleys cut into them. In addition to metamorphic rocks, fracture tectonics and sediments from the Tertiary period also shape the relief. In the eastern Rodopes, the Arda River, which flows eastwards towards the Marica or Hebros, divides the mountain range into a northern and a larger southern branch. The southern slope of the Rodopē Mountains and its southern foothills are on Greek territory. A strip of flat lowlands up to 25 km wide leads to the northern coast of the Aegean Sea. In the area of Mount Ismaros near Marōneia, however, the foothills of the Rodopē Mountains reach as far as the coast, and to the west of it, Lake Bistōnis, which adjoins the bay of the same name near Peritheōrion east of Xanthē, reaches the foot of the mountains.'),

        _l('The provinces of Pisidia, Phrygia I (Phrygia Pakatianē) and Phrygia II (Phrygia Salutaris or Salutaria) join Lycaonia and Galatia to the west; the N-S extension is almost identical. In the far north of this area lies the provincial capital Eskişehir, which is also important as a transport hub (road and railway); other important modern centres are Denizli in the southwest and Isparta in the southeast of the area. Regarding Pisidia, it should be noted that the early Byzantine province shifted considerably to the north and especially to the east compared to the ancient landscape of the same name. Only the easternmost areas of Pisidia and Phrygia II still have a share in the Central Anatolian Highlands. Otherwise, both Phrygian provinces lie almost exclusively in the area of the diverse mountain and basin landscapes of the so-called Inner West Anatolian Threshold (also referred to as the "West Anatolian Mountain and Plateau Landscape"), which forms a transitional landscape to the Aegean region to the west. The landscape character of most of Pisidia is determined by the chains of the western and central Taurus Mountains. These initially stretch from southwestern Turkey to the northeast until, in the border area of Pisidia, the Phrygia II and the Galatia II, they bend to the southeast at an acute angle, beginning with the Sultan Dağları.'),
        _l('These outer main ranges of the western and central Taurus enclose the Pisidian core areas. Characteristic of this mountainous landscape are the numerous lakes, which often have only karstic, underground outlets. The largest lakes of this "Western Taurus" or "Pisidian" lake area are the Pusgusē Limnē/Beyşehir Gölü, the Eğridir Gölü (no old name known), Turkey\'s second and third largest lakes, and the Askania Limnē/Burdur Gölü, a salt lake. North of the Pusgusē Limnē/Beyşehir Gölü and south of the Sultan Dağları (highest elevation 2,531 m), which can only be crossed on difficult mountain roads and paths, lies the capital of the province, Pisidian Antiocheia/Yalvaç, in a hilly highland.'),
        _l('Pisidia is thus a distinctly mountainous region. It is part of the mountainous regions of the western Taurus, whose inner chains sweep here partly N-S, partly NW-SE, and which reach the high mountain region in many places (consistently over 2,000 m, the highest elevation being the Dipoyraz Dağı at 2,980 m in the Dedegöl Dağları chain west of the Pusgusē Limnē/Beyşehir Gölü). The most important towns and settlements are mainly located in the mountainous areas such as Sagalassos/Ağlasun or Adada in the border area with Pamphylia, some also in the smaller plateaus or in the river valleys [upper reaches of the Kestros/Aksu and the Eurymedōn/Köprü Irmağı (and their tributaries), both of which flow into the Gulf of Attaleia/Antalya]. With the westernmost city of Pisidia, Apameia (Kibōtos)/ Dinar, which lies at (or one of) the source of the Maiandros/Büyük Menderes Irmağı, an offshoot of Pisidia also reaches the border with the Aegean region.'),
        _l('Due to the aforementioned northward and eastward shift of Pisidia, this province advances from the eastern slope of the Sultan Dağları belonging to the Taurus in an offshore mountainous area far to the east towards Lycaonia, up to the vicinity of Ikonion/Konya and thus towards the Inner Anatolian highlands, but remains largely confined to its mountainous fringes. The two shallow, drainless lakes off the Sultan Dağları, the Eber Gölü and the Akşehir Gölü, which probably still formed a lake in Byzantine times, the Tessarakonta Martyrōn Limnē, the "Lake of the Forty Martyrs" (namely of Sebastē), lie in the border area between Pisidia and Galatia II.'),
        _l('The two Phrygian provinces adjoin Pisidia to the north and west. To a large extent, they thus lie in the area of the "Inner West Anatolian Threshold" (or the West Anatolian Mountain and Plateau Landscape). The eastern part of Phrygia II or Salutaris (Salutaria), along the border with Galatia, lies in a transition zone where landscape and climatic influences of the Central Anatolian Highlands interpenetrate with effects of the Mediterranean climate (especially in the forestation) from Western Asia Minor. The so-called Phrygian Highlands adjoin the Emir Dağları to the north, which, as the numerous ancient Phrygian rock monuments show, was one of the central residential areas of the Phrygians in antiquity. The landscapes of the Phrygian Highlands, which mostly reach an altitude of 1,100 to 1,400 m above sea level, are characterised by the dense layer of volcanic tuff, which covers large parts of the area, comparable to corresponding areas of Cappadocia. This tuff has different degrees of hardness. For this reason, mesas with vertical rock faces, eroded to varying degrees, remained on the plateaus in many cases, into which sculptured façades, tombs and entire necropolises, churches, monasteries and residential complexes were carved from the ancient Phrygian to the Byzantine period. The façades and caves preserved many more monuments in a small space than in other areas of Asia Minor. From Türkmen Baba, the highest elevation in the Phrygian Highlands at 1,829 m, the highlands drop rapidly to the valleys of the Porsuk Çayı/Tembros and its right tributaries. Here, as mentioned, characteristics of the Central Anatolian Highlands and its steppe landscape increasingly appear until Phrygia II ends north of Dorylaion/Eskişehir on the heights of the Sündiken Dağları, the border to Bithynia, which already belongs to the North Anatolian Rim Mountains. The south-western slope of the Phrygian Highlands is followed by a densely populated depression zone (Afyon Karahisar depression), almost 100 km long and divided into several basins, which extends from the valley of the Upper Tembros/Porsuk Çay in the north-west to the Tessarakonta Martyrōn Limnē (Eber Gölü and Akşehir Gölü).'),
        _l('Phrygia I, which follows Phrygia II in a broad strip to the west, albeit somewhat shifted to the south overall, also lies largely in the area of the Inner West Anatolian Sill, which has already been mentioned several times. Only in the area of the middle Maiandros/Büyük Menderes and the lower reaches of its left tributary, the Lykos/Aksu Çayı, does Phrygia I extend into the West Anatolian Aegean region. In this area lies the capital of the province, Laodikeia on the Lykos (near present-day Denizli). The landscape is dominated by plateaus cut by the large river valleys such as the Maiandros and its tributaries as well as the Hermos/Gediz Çayı, which flow west into the Aegean, and the headwaters of the Makestos/Simav Çayı and the Ryndakos/Kocasu, which are already heading towards the Sea of Marmara. Above the plateaus rise individual, partly volcanic mountains and entire mountain ranges, which in places reach the high mountain zone. In between, especially in the southern sections, there are often depressions with small rivers flowing through them, forming ova-like landscapes. An example of this is the Phrygian Pentapolis ("five-city"), a small landscape that contains five cities and a number of smaller, non-urban settlements in an approximately 30 km long, south-north oriented valley and its peripheral areas.'),

The Glaukos Potamos (Kızıl Dere), after which the gulf was also called Glaukos Kolpos, flows into the Gulf of Fethiye (Makrē). The second longest Lycian river, the Xanthos (Esen Çayı), rises in the hinterland of the Glaukos Kolpos. In its valley and estuary there were numerous important cities, such as Pinara, Tlōs, Xanthos and Patara.

In the hinterland, partly already high up in the Taurus, were Ariassos at the most important pass to Pisidia and the Antolian highlands, Krēmna, Pednēlissos, Selgē (Zerk, today Altınyayla), Kolybrassos (Ayasofya) and on a steep rocky cone Kasai, where an extensive legal inscription of the 5th century was engraved on the outside of the apse of the church.'),
        _l('In the far west, the Katarraktēs (Düden Çayı), which partly came underground from Lycia, flowed into Antalya. With its lime-rich water, it formed the travertine terraces of Antalya. The valley of the Kestros (Aksu), which rises at Kovada Gölü in Pisidia, was also an important traffic route that the Apostle Paulos followed from Pergē. Pergē also had a river port on the Kestros. Between Syllaion, which was situated on a prominent mesa above the Pamphylian plain and, like Attaleia, became a defensive centre against the Arabs in Byzantine times, and Sidē, Pamphylia\'s longest river, at 156 km, flows from the Pisidian Anamas Mountain to its mouth south of Aspendos, which was on the right (western) bank of the river. The river owes its present name Köprü Irmağı to the Seljuk bridge that stands next to the old collapsed Roman bridge. When the crusaders of the Second Crusade arrived at the river in 1148, the old bridge no longer existed and they had to swim the river in winter, being attacked by the Turks and largely killed. The few survivors probably came to the Holy Land by ship from Sidē, as attested by a hoard of coins with silver pennies buried in Sidē from the first half of the 12th century. East of Sidē, the Melas (Manavgat Çayı) once flowed into the river, from whose valley the 30 km long water pipeline with many aquaeduct bridges led to Sidē. The water conduit originated in today\'s Oymaağaç reservoir, and the mouth of the Melas today has been moved further east by its own alluvial deposits. Instead of a bridge over the deep river, there was a ferry at present-day Manavgat in ancient times.'),

        _l('North of Galatia, between Bithynia in the west and Helenopontos in the east, along the coast of the Black Sea, stretch the provinces of Paphlagonia and Honōrias; the latter was only newly created at the beginning of the 5th century from the eastern part of Bithynia and the western part of Paphlagonia. The main modern cities of this area are Ereğli and Zonguldak on the coast in the west and Sinop (already just outside Paphlagonia) in the east. In the interior, Bolu/ Klaudiupolis and Çankırı/Gangra should be mentioned. The provinces lie almost entirely in the area of the North Anatolian (Pontic) Rim Mountains, which consist of several chains running parallel to the Black Sea. Only a few mountains, such as Köroğlu Tepesi at 2,365 m in the west or some peaks of Oligas Oros/Ilgaz Dağları in the east, exceed the 2,000 m mark. In accordance with the coastline, the chains in the western part of Honōrias and Paphlagonia essentially maintain a direction from west-northwest to east-northeast, which roughly changes to a W-E direction at the level of Cape Karambis/ Kerempe Burnu. Since, as already mentioned, the coast initially runs predominantly east-northeast, but the southern border towards Galatia runs eastwards on average, the number of parallel chains, and in part also their width, increases towards the east. The chain structure of the North Anatolian Rim Mountains means that the larger rivers, especially those which still have their source in the Central Anatolian Highlands or at least south of the northern chains of the mountain range, often follow the tectonic valleys between the chains over longer distances, i.e. roughly in a W-E or W-W direction. This means that they flow roughly in a W-E or E-W direction and then, often with abrupt changes of direction, break through narrow valleys between the individual mountain ranges of a chain to the next parallel valley to the north, which they then follow in the opposite direction. The best example in Paphlagonia and the Honōrias is provided by the largest stream in this area, the Billaios/Filyos Çayı, whose headwaters rise at Köroğlu Tepesi. As Gerede Çayı it flows in an east-northeasterly direction south past Krateia/Gerede; after a course of more than 100 km it swings in a (on average) west-northwesterly direction and breaks through the western Oligas Oros/Ilgaz Dağları in a narrow valley as Soğanlı Çay. At Karabük, it takes up the Araç Çayı, which had previously flowed about 80 km in an E-W direction, and is now usually called Yenice Çayı. Only 30 km before it flows into the Black Sea does it change to a purely northward direction as Filyos Çayı, now flowing in a wide valley.'),
        _l('Climatically, the North Anatolian Rim Mountains belong to the rainy areas of Turkey. However, the parallel chains have a strong influence on the vegetation and thus the appearance of the landscapes due to repeated windward-leeward effects. In general, the north-facing windward sides receive significantly more rain than the south-facing leeward sides. Therefore, the humid forests of the windward sides (mixed deciduous forests, beech forests, finally fir forests rising from the sea) on the leeward sides, especially of the southern, higher chains, already change into dry forests with various pine species and oaks. The southern slopes of the southern chains, i.e. already in the border area to Galatia, are partly already bare; however, here the forests may have fallen victim to human impact. This is especially true for the southeastern foothills of Paphlagonia with the capital Gangra, which climatically already belongs to the Central Anatolian Highlands.'),
        _l('The coasts of Honōrias and Paphlagonia are not very indented and therefore have few major natural harbours, apart from the estuaries of some rivers. For the most part, the mountains slope steeply down to the sea. Only in the west of the Honōrias is there a narrow coastal plain from the mouth of the Sangario/Sakarya Nehri to a little east of Akçakoca. Then flatter shores do not appear again until the easternmost part of the Paphlagonian coast in the border area with Helenopontos towards Sinōpē/ Sinop, where the mountains of the coastal range generally become lower.'),
        _l('Across the Honōrias and Paphlagonia, between the more northerly chains of the North Anatolian Rim Mountains and the elongated range now collectively known as the Köroğlu Dağları, runs the so-called North Anatolian Depression Furrow (also Bolu- Kargı Furrow), which has continuations to the west towards the Sea of Marmara and to the east towards Lake Van. One of the main fault lines runs through Asia Minor here, making the area particularly prone to earthquakes. However, this "furrow" is not a continuous trench, but consists of individual subsidence planes and basins lying one behind the other, as well as elongated valley areas, which are separated from each other by watersheds, some of which are considerably higher. Nevertheless, in Roman and Byzantine times, the most important road from Constantinople to eastern Asia Minor led through this furrow to Lake Van, with branches to all the important cities on the Black Sea and the Euphrates.'),

This current initially runs roughly westwards, then southwards along the Greek coast or Euboea. In contrast, a cooler inflow comes from the south from the central Mediterranean, which ultimately originates from the Atlantic. This current runs northwards along the coast of Asia Minor and partly enters the Dardanelles as an undercurrent. In many respects, shipping was partly determined by the use of the currents; the straits at Chios and Lesbos and especially the entrance to the Dardanelles, where there could be days of waiting in the port of Tenedos as a result of the counter-currents and the north-easterly winds, were feared.'),

The Moglena basin and the Ludias valley are separated from the Axios/Vardar valley to the east by the Païkon Mountains (1,650 m), which consist mainly of limestone. From the Bermion Mountains, the plain of Campania extends about 80 km to the east.'),
        _l('The wider hinterland of Thessalonikē and around Thermaios Kolpos was a deep tectonic trench in the early Neogene with a NNW-SSO orientation, which was filled by sediments over time and flooded by rising sea levels in the Holocene. The rivers Haliakmōn, Ludias, Axios and Galikos flow into this former part of the sea. The former Lake of Giannitsa in the middle of the Campania was a shallow, marshy, partly silted body of water fed mainly by the Ludias, which had an area of about 100 km2 at the beginning of the 20th century. Until ancient times, the lake was an extension of the Gulf of Thessalonikē. In the course of draining the lake (in the 1930s), the course of the Ludias was greatly altered and most of its water was diverted to the Haliakmōn. The broad plain of the Axios or Vardar valley, which extends from the demarcation against TIB 16 (roughly also modern state border) to Thermaïkos Kolpos, covers an area of about 40 km in the E-W direction and 70 km in the N-S direction. The rivers mentioned, especially the water-rich Haliakmōn and Axios/Vardar, have in the course of the centuries shifted the coast of Thermaios Kolpos considerably to the south in their estuary area through their alluvium. The extensive lowland is the southern end of the great Vardar furrow, which continues over the southwestern edge of the Chalkidikē into the Kassandra peninsula.'),
        _l('The eastern boundary of the broad plain of the Axios valley against the Strymōn valley is formed by low mountains (Krusia, Maurobuni, Bertiskos, the Orē Bolbēs, Kerdylia Orē; all below 1,200 m altitude), which extend from lakes Doïranē and Kerkinē in the northwest to lakes Lankada and Bolbē in the southeast. With a length of about 80 km and a width of about 35 km, they are the largest geomorphological unit in Eastern Macedonia. The lakes Lankada (42 km2, 75 m above sea level) and east of it Bolbē (70 km2, 37 m above sea level) are remnants of a single large Pleistocene lake (Mygdonia limnē) and form a contiguous hydrotop draining eastwards via the Rēchios into the Strymonikos Kolpos.'),

The length of this largely closed depression, which runs mainly in a south-easterly direction, is about 80 km, its width up to 30 km. In geological terms, the lower Strymōn Valley is the boundary between the Serbian-Macedonian Massif in the west and the Thracian Massif of the Rodopes in the east. Two lakes have formed in the valley as extensions of the river, Lake Kerkinē in the northwest and Lake Achianos (approximately between 80 and 140 km2 depending on the water level) in the southeast. Between 1931 and 1933, this landscape was fundamentally reshaped by river regulation. The upper lake, the Kerkinē, was enlarged as a reservoir for irrigation, the lower lake was drained and cultivated. In the agriculturally productive region, navigation on Lake Achianos facilitated the transport of goods. The north-eastern boundary of the lower Strymōn valley is formed by the western foothills or foothills of the Rodopes, in particular the Orē Brontus with its iron ore deposits and the Menoikion Mountains, which slope steeply towards the south-east and show karst features such as funnel-shaped depressions (sinkholes) and rivers (ponors or catabothras) running underground for a longer or shorter distance. About 15 km north of the mouth of the Strymōn River, the depression of the Angitēs Valley meets the Strymōn Valley vertically from the northeast. The Angitēs comes from the Drama basin, which extends over a distance of 50 km from its sources to close to the port city of Kabala. The basin, which is up to 25 km wide, is surrounded by mountains consisting mainly of limestone and marble (Pangaion to the south, Menoikion to the northwest, Phalakron to the north and the Orē Lekanēs to the east). The mountains north and east of Drama slope in a north-easterly direction towards the middle Nestos valley, which forms the eastern boundary of the processing area (with TIB 6).'),

This usage was applied to the title of the volume. In terms of content, however, the term is broader, since the text of the book goes beyond the landscapes of Eurōpē to include places in the adjacent former provinces of Rodopē and Haimimontos, so that these 1) belong to Turkish national territory and 2) have not been taken into account in TIB 6 "Thrace", a fact which can be explained, for example, by an increase in knowledge due to new archaeological finds. Well-known cities such as Edirne (Adrianupolis), Kırklareli (Saranta Ekklēsiai, Quaranta Chiese), Pınarhisar (Brysis) or Babaeski (Bulgarophygon) belonged to the province of Haimimontos and are therefore, since they were dealt with in TIB 6, just as little subsumed here under the term "Eastern Thrace" as Enez (Ainos) at the mouth of the Hebros, which belonged to the province of Rodopē.

This differentiation, which may seem somewhat complicated, is a consequence of the division of the Byzantine national territory into working regions made in the early stages of the project, which were to be dealt with in the volumes of the series. From this specification, a terminology developed which, in the case at hand, deviates from the usual linguistic usage. Starting from the German term, a TIB volume on "Eastern Thrace" would of course deal with the whole of European Turkey.'),

A conspicuous elevation in the south, on the coast of the Sea of Marmara, is the Işıklar dağı or Mount Ganos, which rises to 927 m and was considered a holy mountain in ancient times. Bordering it to the southwest is the particularly eye-catching Chersones peninsula, about 80 km long, whose northern shores mostly slope steeply down to the sea, while the southern side is flat and indented by numerous small streams and rivers. To the north-east of the once important town of Sēstos, the Ürey dağı rises to 359 m as the highest hill. To the north of the peninsula lies the Hebros plain, which can be up to ten kilometres wide. To the east of this, in the Enez catchment area, lies the hilly country of the Hisarlı dağı, which rises to 385 metres. In the north-east of European Turkey, in the border area of the former provinces of Haimimontos and Eurōpē, the İstranca Mountains run from north-west to south-east, crossed by numerous small rivers, whose highest peak is the Mahya dağı at 1,031 m - the highest elevation in the entire region. To the south is the rump plate country of the İstanbul Peninsula, which continues geologically beyond the Bosporos to the lower reaches of the Sakarya (Sangarios) River on the eastern border of Bithynia. The most important river in Eastern Thrace is the Ergene (Rēgina), about 230 km long, which rises in the south-eastern foothills of the İstranca Mountains and, after numerous meanders in a predominantly westerly flow direction, flows into the Hebros not far from İpsala (Kypsela) and the Greek state border. The latter is the most important river in Thrace with a length of 472 km, but it hardly touches the eastern Thracian area and thus remains of secondary importance in this context. Beach lakes, which are often only separated from the sea by narrow headlands, can be found in various places in Thrace. These include the Durusu gölü (Derkōn limnē), measuring a good 12 km2 , near the Black Sea, the Küçükçekmece gölü (Rēgion kolpos) and the Büyükçekmece gölü (Athyra kolpos) to the west, not far from the Sea of Marmara, in the wider catchment area of İstanbul, furthermore two salt lakes now called Tuzla gölü on the north coast of the Gulf of Saros, which makes up the north-easternmost part of the Aegean, or the Tuz gölu in the south-west of the Chersones.'),

Earth-historically, both waterways were ancient river valleys. These seas, especially the Black Sea and the Aegean, shape the climate and landscape in different ways, although less pronounced compared to the more easterly coasts of the Black Sea and the more southerly ones of the Aegean. In the area of the Sea of Marmara and the two waterways leading from it, there are broad transition zones. In Bithynia, the parts of İstanbul, İzmit and Bursa lying on the Asian shore of the Bosporus and the Sea of Marmara are to be mentioned as the most important cities, in Hellespont Çanakkale on the coast of the Dardanelles and Balıkesir deep in the Mysian Hills.'),

Similar to the eastern parts of the province of Eurōpē (Eastern Thrace; TIB 12), the Bithynian Peninsula presents itself as an "undulating mountain and hill landscape" or as a "low hill and hull clod land". The mountains (so-called hardscapes of more resistant rock) are found mainly along the east coast of the Sea of Marmara and the north coast of the Gulf of Nicomēdeia/İzmit, where the highest peaks, which include the offshore Prince Islands, reach 500 to 600 m above sea level.

The chain-forming Arganthōnion Mountains advance westwards into the Propontis like a peninsula; together with the adjacent mountain ranges to the east, the mountainous area that stretches north of the Askania Limnē/İznik Gölü to the east is today grouped under the name Samanlı Dağları.

Hills and low mountains, into which deep river valleys are cut, accompany the shores of the Dardanelles and the western half of the southern coast of the Sea of Marmara to the shallow estuary of the Granikos. From here, an undulating plain, closed in the south by mountains with heights of up to 500 m, stretches to the mouth of the Aisēpos. East of this estuary, the hills also reach the coast again. The peninsula of Kyzikos/Kapıdağ Yarımadası, which extends triangularly northwards into the Sea of Marmara, and the offshore islands as well as the coastal mountains to the east (Sigrianē/Karadağ) are also mountainous and largely forested.

Their ridge line roughly forms the border to the adjoining province of Asia to the south, so that the southern coast of the Trōas, which also climatically already belongs to the Aegean region, no longer belongs to Hellespont. Towards the east, the chains of the Ida Mountains rapidly lose height and merge into a river-rich mountain and hill country, in which individual mountain massifs replace the chains. Especially east of Adrianu Thērai/Balıkesir, there are also extensive plains at around 100 to 150 m above sea level. On the eastern edge of these plains, the middle Makestos/Simav Çayı flows in a deeply incised valley, forming narrow breakthrough valleys in places. To the south towards the Lydian border, to the southeast towards Phrygia, and to the east and northeast towards Adrianeia/Dursunbey and Adrianoi/Orhaneli, the plains and hills merge again into distinctly mountainous lands, bordering the foothills of the Bithynian or Mysian Olympus/Ulu Dağ to the northeast of Adrianoi.'),

A large part of this area is now flooded by a reservoir (Debarsko Ezero).'),
        _l('On the territory of Bulgaria, at the north-eastern edge of the TIB 16 study area, there is first the basin of Kyustendil, which connects south-west to the basin of Radomir and is crossed by the Struma River in a south-easterly direction. East of Kyustendil, the Rila Mountains form a compact mountain mass with high mountain character. Northwest of these mountains lies the Dupnica and Sapareva Banya basins, through which the Džermen River flows. North of Blagoevgrad, the Struma valley widens into a basin with about 10 km E-W and about 5 km N-S extension. In this section, the Struma river valley is framed by the Pirin Mountains to the east and the Vlaina Mountains to the west, while to the south it is bordered by the Kresna Pass (Kresnenskijat prolom, Kresnenskoto defile, Kresnenskata klisura), where the Maleševska planina to the west and the Pirin Mountains to the east meet. At this narrow point, the Struma breaks through and flows in a southerly direction towards the Aegean Sea. The area south of the Kresna Pass is bordered by the Pirin Mountains to the east, the Rupel Pass, the Slavjanka (Ali Botuš) and the Belasica Mountains to the south and southwest, and the Ogražden and Maleševska planina to the west. It is connected to the towns of Strumica and Štip to the west and northwest via the Strumešnica (Strumica) valley.'),
        _l('According to the relief, the processing area is a mountain and basin country. About 80% of the territory is hilly or mountainous, the remaining 20% plain. The TIB 16 study area is mainly characterised by rivers draining to the south, which lead to the partly marshy, fertile coastal plains of the Thermaic Gulf and the northern Aegean Sea. The rivers of northern Macedonia belong to three river basins. The Aegean river basin is the largest with a catchment area of 87% of the country\'s territory, followed by the Adriatic with about 12% and the small remainder accounted for by the Danube river basin. The longest and largest river in Northern Macedonia is the Vardar with a total length of 388 km. Of this, about 300 km are in Northern Macedonia. In southwestern Bulgaria, the Struma is the longest and largest river with about 415 km, of which 290 km are in Bulgaria. It rises on the slopes of the Vitoša Mountains at 2,180 m above sea level and flows first in a northerly, then westerly direction to the village of Pernik, before finally turning south to Greece and flowing into the Aegean Sea. From the point of view of limnology, the processing area is rich in findings. In the Republic of Northern Macedonia there are a total of 160 lakes, of which 50 are natural and 110 are artificial reservoirs. The largest natural lakes are Lake Ohrid (area 348.8 km2), Great Prespa Lake (area 274 km2) and Dojran Lake (area 43 km2).'),
