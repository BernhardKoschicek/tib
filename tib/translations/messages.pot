"The project “Medieval Smyrna/Izmir” probes the question as to how the "
"city of Smyrna and its hinterland developed from its last heydays under "
"Byzantine rule in the 13th century to the Ottoman conquest in the 15th "
"century. During this period, the western coastland of Asia Minor "
"underwent not only substantial environmental change but also profound "
"political, cultural, and religious transformations, in the course of "
"which Byzantine-Christian institutions, structures, and elites were "
"gradually superseded by Muslim-Turkish entities and eventually absorbed "
"into the nascent Ottoman Empire. The project examines this multilayered "
"process through an interdisciplinary approach combining historical "
"geography with methods of social and economic history and archaeology. It"
" combines key components of Byzantine-Turkish transformation with broader"
" archaeological questions concerning long-term patterns of settlement and"
" human agency shaping the region’s entire medieval period. These axes of "
"investigation will revolve around five thematic subunits, namely (a) "
"environment, land use, economic practices, (b) political ideology, "
"government, institutions, (c) urban life, (d) suburban and rural life; "
"(e) religious spaces and practices. In this way, the project aspires to "

"A famous example of a relief map of the Balkan Peninsula in the former "
"Yugoslavia is the map of Montenegro and adjacent territories, which was "
"made in 1916/17 by order of the Austro-Hungarian military administration "
"and is now located in the courtyard of the former royal residence "
"\"Biljarda\" (now the National Museum of Montenegro) in Cetinje in the "
"Republic of Montenegro. The National Museum of Montenegro in Cetinje "
"reports about the relief map on its homepage on the Internet as follows: "
"\"After the Austro-Hungarian army made the breakthrough of the Lovćen "
"front and occupied Cetinje in 1916, a glazed object with a relief map of "
"Montenegro at a scale of 1:10,000 was erected on two levels in the south "
"wing of the \"Biljarda\" residence, where the headquarters of the "
"occupation troops was also located. The relief, which shows parts of "
"Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Albania and Serbia, among others, "
"consists of a concrete mass on a stone base and was prepared on the basis"
" of precise Austrian topographic maps and land surveys, which in turn had"
" been prepared using the most modern means. To determine the elevations "
"on the map, a network of thin metal rods was used, around which the space"
" in between was filled manually to match the landscape characteristics. "
"The surface was then painted in detail so that it contained all the "
"relevant information about the road network of that time, water areas, "
"forests and populated places. For a better overview of the map, a bridge "
"was built over its central part, from which every single detail was "
"visible. In addition to Austro-Hungarian military cartographers, "
"Montenegrin prisoners of war were also involved in the production of the "
"relief map, including our famous sculptor Marko Brežanin. The old "
"protective superstructure was demolished in the early 1980s and replaced "
"by a glazed metal structure, which is still in use now. The relief map of"
" Montenegro was declared a cultural monument (cultural property) by "
"Decision No. 1794/1 of September 14, 1948. Apart from the undoubtedly "
"military-strategic purposes it had during the war years, this unique "
"object has gained importance over time due to its aesthetic and "
"historical value, so that it now forms an inevitable tourist "

"Macedonia. In the Middle Ages, Macedonia was a region of contacts between"
" Byzantine Greeks and Slavs (e. g. Bulgarians, Serbs). The metropolis of "
"Thessalonica was of great importance in political, cultural and economic "

"developed into a center of monasticism and extended its spiritual and "

"Western Asia Minor was already an important landscape in ancient times, "
"enriched by numerous settlements with enormous cultural potential and "
"considerable economic power. In this region, the Romans established their"
" first province in Anatolia, in the year 129 BC. Consequently, they "
"called the region Asia. Some centuries later, in the time of Emperor "
"Diocletian (284–305), the huge province with a size of more than 150,000 "
"square kilometers was divided into several smaller units, which continued"
" to exist in the early Byzantine period. One of them was Lydia, about "
"16,000 square kilometers in size, with its central places in Sardis "
"(Sart), Thyateira (Akhisar) and Philadelphia (Alaşehir). The most "
"important rivers were Hermos (Gediz çay) and Cogamus (Alaşehir çay). The "
"new province of Asia owns only 19,100 square kilometers; it was "
"considerably smaller than the former Roman one. Among its central market "
"places, one has to mention Ephesus (Selçuk), Pergamum (Bergama), Smyrna "
"(İzmir) and Magnesia (Manisa); its main river is the Meander (Büyük "
"Menderes Nehri). The project “Western Asia Minor” is dedicated to this "
"core region of the Byzantine Empire, the mentioned landscapes will be "

" and breaks through the Tauros in a narrow gorge near Faraşa (Byzantine "
"Rodandos). In its lower course, it still receives tributaries that come "
"from the high valley of Karsantı below the Ala Dağ. This was one of the "
"centres of the Armenians expelled from High Armenia, who founded a "

"later in Lambrun (Çamlıyayla) in the foothills of the Tauros northwest of"
" Tarsus. The following dynasty of the Hethumids resided a little further "

"From an orographic and hydrographic point of view, the processing area of"

"Polog). Polog is bordered by Šar Planina to the west, Suva Gora to the "

"the scale of 1:800,000 with the headwords marked onto it. Special symbols"

"The original plan to produce maps on the scale of 1:1,000,000 in the "

"and the former Institute of Cartography of the Austrian Academy of "
"Sciences designed a map for the whole Mediterranean on the above-"
"mentioned larger scale. This enabled a more thorough topographic approach"
" and facilitated the entry of headwords. If necessary, even a larger "
"scale is applied for some regions (e.g. 1:400,000). The scholarly work of"
" the TIB focuses on the regions / provinces of the Byzantine Empire. "

"On the basis of this approach the scholarly work of the TIB shifted "
"towards those core regions (\"Kerngebiete\") in the 1990s. Consequently, "
"the fifth volume on \"Kilikien und Isaurien\" (TIB 5) was printed in "
"1990. Volume 7 entitled \"Phrygien und Pisidien\" (TIB 7) was published "
"in the same year. One year later, Peter Soustal completed the sixth "
"volume of the TIB (TIB 6) on \"Thrakien (Thrakē, Rodopē und "
"Haimimontos)\". All three volumes were presented to a wider audience at "
"the XVIIIth International Congress of Byzantine Studies in Moscow in "
"August 1991. In 1995 Prof. Dr. Johannes Koder became chairman of the "
"overall project of the TIB (following Prof. Dr. Herbert Hunger). Since "
"1995 the ninth volume (TIB 9) on \"Paphlagonien und Honorias\", the tenth"
" (TIB 10) on \"Aigaion Pelagos (Die nördliche Ägäis)\" and the eighth "
"volume (TIB 8) on \"Lykien und Pamphylien\" have been accomplished. In "
"2008 Andreas Külzer published the twelfth volume (TIB 12) on "
"\"Ostthrakien (Eurōpē)\", while in 2014 TIB 15 (Syria) covering the "
"provinces \"Syria Prōtē, Syria Deutera and Syria Euphratēsia\" was edited"
" (by the external cooperation partners K.-P. Todt and B. A. Vest, from "
"the University of Mainz)."
