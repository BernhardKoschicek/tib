    Smyrna/Izmir, nowadays the third most populated city and a bustling economic center in modern Turkey, is situated in one of the Mediterranean’s most exciting crossroads of cultures littered with remains of ancient sites and monuments of different periods. There is a long tradition of archaeological research on classical, Hellenistic, and early Christian sites of the region; and Smyrna’s significance as an international hub of trade in the late Ottoman Empire have attracted the interest of numerous scholars. Since 2008, the Tabula Imperii Byzantini (TIB) project at the Austrian Academy of Sciences has been focusing on the historical geography of Western Asia Minor in Late Antiquity and Byzantine times and has been gathering the surviving written and material evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
   The project “Medieval Smyrna/Izmir” probes the question as to how the city of Smyrna and its hinterland developed from its last heydays under Byzantine rule in the 13th century to the Ottoman conquest in the 15th century. During this period, the western coastland of Asia Minor underwent not only substantial environmental change but also profound political, cultural, and religious transformations, in the course of which Byzantine-Christian institutions, structures, and elites were gradually superseded by Muslim-Turkish entities and eventually absorbed into the nascent Ottoman Empire. The project examines this multilayered process through an interdisciplinary approach combining historical geography with methods of social and economic history and archaeology. It combines key components of Byzantine-Turkish transformation with broader archaeological questions concerning long-term patterns of settlement and human agency shaping the region’s entire medieval period. These axes of investigation will revolve around five thematic subunits, namely (a) environment, land use, economic practices, (b) political ideology, government, institutions, (c) urban life, (d) suburban and rural life; (e) religious spaces and practices. In this way, the project aspires to achieve a comprehensive reconstruction of transformative processes, which includes both material aspects of living conditions and the symbolic universe of different population groups.
    </p>
    <p>
   The archaeological research will document currently existing material evidence of historical habitation, thus promoting future collaborations in the field of Byzantine archaeology in Anatolia. The historical research aims to produce a transposable case study of socio-cultural transformation, which will help elucidate similar processes in other parts and periods of the Mediterranean up to modern times.

    In the current discourse on the integration of the Western Balkans into the European Union the ongoing and envisaged negotiations with the Republics of Montenegro, Serbia and Albania seem to be of remarkable importance in the contemporary media coverage. They comprise a region, which – in a long ago past – played, under the name of Illyricum (Illyrikon), a vital role in the strategic and administrative considerations of the Byzantine Empire.
    </p>
    <p>
    The project builds upon a scholarly cooperation among the academic fields of Byzantine Studies, Medieval History, Historical Geography, Art History, Geography and Geocommunication (GIScience and Cartography) and focuses on two historic regions of “Duklja” and “Raška” being part of the Illyricum. The research hypothesis is that both historic regions constituted a “Sacred Landscape”, which we intend to decipher and to communicate to academia as well as to the interested public with the joint means of Historical Geography, Art History and Geocommunication.
    </p>
    <p>
    Therefore, the project aims at approaching and researching systematically the following three major questions:
    </p>
    <p>
    (1) In which way did the local rulers and the Churches of Rome and Constantinople interact in the regions of “Duklja” and “Raška” from the 11th to the 14th centuries and how is this very interaction mirrored in the distribution pattern of monuments (i.e. the churches and monasteries) in this “Sacred Landscape”?
    </p>
    <p>
    (2) Did the volatile religious affiliation of the local rulers have an impact on the “Sacred Landscape” and where were Latin or Byzantine places of worship transformed or superimposed in the course of time?
    </p>
    <p>
    (3) Can the religious and cultural influence of the Latin and Byzantine (Orthodox) faith be traced through small Latin (i.e. “Western”) as well as Byzantine and Slavic (i.e. “Eastern”) objects of art, not only in the coastal area, but also in its hinterland and in Italy? Both historic regions could prove to be constituting a zone “Beyond East and West”, subject to remarkable processes of transformation from the 11th to the 14th centuries, and have the huge potential to offer data suitable for visualisations as well as formalisation by GIScience. The integration and presentation of the research data (i.e. on the written sources, monuments and objects of art) of the project will be achieved through an already existing database and an online <a hrf="https://data1.geo.univie.ac.at/projects/tibapp">map application</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    The project is exclusively feasible through a multidisciplinary approach and cooperation between three project partners from Austria (Austrian Academy of Sciences, here Priv.-Doz. Mag. Dr. Mihailo Popović; University of Vienna, here Professor Dr. Karel Kriz) and Germany (Hochschule für Technik, Wirtschaft und Kultur Leipzig, here Professor Dr. Johannes Tripps).Moreover, it is closely connected to the ongoing scholarly work of Mihailo Popović on <a href="/current_status/TIB_17">TIB volume 17 “Nea Epeiros and Praevalis”</a> and on the TIB Sub Project <a href="sub_projects/montenegro">“Cultural Heritage in Times of World War I: The Case of the Austro-Hungarian Relief Map of Montenegro (1916-1918)”</a>.

The project aims to investigate the historical use of the Bulgarian coastline within the wider port networks and maritime connectivity of the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. A systematic archaeological study of the topographic evolution of the coast in association to the functionality of port sites and other coastal facilities during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages shall provide new data on the development of coastal life and especially the nature of agricultural and industrial exploitation in context of maritime commerce. Particularly the continuously alternating relationship between the coast and river landscapes are to be emphasized. Based on written sources, historical accounts and already existing archaeological data, a comprehensive catalogue and database of harbor sites, anchorages and natural environments such as bays or river courses and their estuaries will be created. Building upon this database, the research project emphasizes on the analysis of the paleo geographic environment linked to sea-level changes in areas of pre-selected archaeological sites. By using Orthophotography and 3D shooting, the research project therefore complements the existing information. Latter will eventually be used for the study of network patterns and comparative studies of port hierarchies and interrelated functionalities of coastal infrastructures. This shall provide a new platform for a better understanding of maritime economy as well as social and cultural connectivity throughout the Black Sea region.

The year of 2018 marks 100 years from the end of one of the most disastrous wars in human history. When the armistice between the Central Powers and the Allied Powers (Entente) was concluded in November 1918, which ended the First World War, millions of soldiers as well as civilians had met their death, landscapes and infrastructure throughout the whole of Europe was devastated, Empires had fallen apart and cultural monuments had been erased to the ground. This project does not focus on the analysis of the armed conflict itself, but will instead shed light on a very special aspect of international and intercultural cooperation in times of war. Today’s Republic of Montenegro (and here the National Museum of Montenegro / Narodni muzej Crne Gore in Cetinje) is preserving a fascinating example of a European cultural monument, which is the result of an Austro-Hungarian and Montenegrin cooperation from 1916 until 1918. In March 1916 the Austro-Hungarian army established its military command in the former Montenegrin capital of Cetinje and here in the palace of the Montenegrin kings called Biljarda. In the same year the Austro-Hungarian General Staff ordered a 3D relief map of entire Montenegro to be made at a scale of 1 : 10,000 in the courtyard of the Biljarda in Cetinje. This relief map with 282 square metres, which was finished in 1917, displays Montenegro itself as well as territories which belong to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Albania and Serbia. The relief map was made of concrete on bedrock in accordance with Austro-Hungarian topographic maps of South-East Europe.
   </p>
    <p>
Although this relief map is a remarkable cultural monument of its time, which was even mentioned as a sight in the Austro-Hungarian newspapers of 1917, and also nowadays, its exact history of production remains obscure. The relief map of Montenegro was declared a monument of culture in 1948 and is representing one of the most important local tourist sights in Cetinje and in overall Montenegro today. That is why scholarly research on the relief map is desperately needed. This project (No. ME 07/2019) between the Long-Term Project Tabula Imperii Byzantini (TIB) at the Institute for Medieval Research, Division of Byzantine Research (Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna) and the Faculty for Culture and Tourism of the University of Donja Gorica (Podgorica) is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research (BMBWF) of the Republic of Austria via the Austrian Agency for International Cooperation in Education and Research (OeAD) and envisages to research archival data on the Austro-Hungarian cartographers and the Montenegrin artists working on the aforesaid relief map, to collect relevant secondary literature, to capture pictures of the relief map with a drone in order to calculate a high resolution digital terrain model and to prepare a joint scholarly article on the project’s results. All of these aspects will be used for the outreach to academia and the interested public in order to emphasise this vivid example of Cultural Heritage in times of war.

Die verheerende Auswirkung von Kriegen auf das Weltkulturerbe wurde nach 1945 umfassend erörtert. Wissenschaftliche Projekte an der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften haben eine lange Tradition darin, einen Beitrag in der Erforschung des Kulturerbes zu leisten. Unter ihnen ist das Projekt Tabula Imperii Byzantini (TIB) zu nennen, das einen historischen Atlas des Byzantinischen Reiches unter besonderer Berücksichtigung der Balkanhalbinsel und Kleinasiens erarbeitet.
   </p>
    <p>
Auf Bereisungen wurden seit 1966 Denkmäler und deren (damaliger) aktueller Zustand mittels Dias dokumentiert. Diese einzigartige Sammlung von byzantinischen Denkmälern (52.000 Dias) ist ein reichhaltiges Kulturgut und ein Angelpunkt zukünftiger Forschungsarbeit. Das Ziel des Projektes besteht darin, drei Fallstudien mit ihren Denkmälern [nämlich "Kilikien und Isaurien" (TIB 5); "Ostthrakien (Europe)" (TIB 12); "Makedonien, nördlicher Teil" (TIB 16)] zu behandeln, um sie sorgfältig durch das Prisma des Kulturerbes (vorher – nachher Zustand) zu betrachten. Diese Fallstudien wurden wegen der komplexen politisch-militärischen Lage im Nahen Osten mit den Auswirkungen auf die Denkmäler in situ (TIB 5) gewählt und weil sie Gebiete umfassen, deren Infrastrukturen sich rasch mit nachhaltigen Folgen für die Landschaften der Vergangenheit und für die jeweiligen Denkmäler (TIB 12 und TIB 16) entwickeln.
   </p>
    <p>
Die Gesamtzahl der zu scannenden Dias beträgt 6.300 (TIB 5: 5.000, TIB 12: 800, TIB 16: 500). Durch die drei Fallstudien werden ein strukturierter und effizienter Workflow sowie eine Best Practice auf diesem Gebiet der Historischen Geographie und der Digitalen Geisteswissenschaften geschaffen.

borderzones_description = """<p>
The European continent as a whole and the European Union in particular are facing a period of increasing dynamics of internal migration as well as external immigration at the moment. Migration in all of its various aspects has always been a part of the history of the European continent. In medieval societies the question of migration is closely connected with the definition as well as the representation of medieval borders. Maps in historical atlases are designed to provide clear-cut lines of political formations and empires, which does not reflect the reality of civilizations neither in Antiquity, nor in the Middle Ages, nor in Early Modern Times. The dynamics of borders simultaneously shapes the dynamics of settlement patterns as well as of transportation networks.
   </p>
    <p>
The respective stand-alone project focuses on the borders of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire in medieval South-East Europe, namely in pre-Ottoman (i.e. Byzantine) Macedonia. Far-reaching political changes occurred in the Southern Balkan Peninsula from the end of the 13th until the middle of the 14th century, when the Serbian medieval kingdom expanded to the South under the king Stefan Uroš II Milutin at the expense of the Byzantine Empire, which lasted until the death of tsar Stefan Uroš IV Dušan (1355). This again had a severe impact on the border zones and cross-border societies between both realms in pre-Ottoman (i.e. Byzantine) Macedonia in the same period, especially in five selected target areas (the Strumica Valley, Lesnovo, Skopje, Ohrid, Prilep).
   </p>
    <p>
Although substantial publications exist on the population of as well as on the migration in Byzantine Macedonia, there is still an urgent need for this kind of research based on written sources and toponyms. Two interrelated research questions will be addressed in two distinct work packages: "Rivalling Political Concepts – Byzantium and the Medieval Serbian Oecumene” and "Cross-Border Societies and Elite Change in Byzantine Macedonia”.
   </p>
    <p>
The initial point form the medieval written sources, i.e. Serbian and Byzantine charters as main corpus, as well as other selected written sources from the medieval Serbian kingdom. The sources will be analysed from the viewpoint of the aforesaid research questions and strongly based on the methods deriving from Historical Geography. Special attention will be given to the analysis of formulations with regard to the Serbian expansion in the area of research, the acquisition of new territories and their administrative incorporation on the macro-level and to the localisation of conquered settlements with related settlement typologies as well as on the change of local elites on a micro-level. Moreover, tools from Digital Humanities in mapping and visualisation will be applied in order to communicate the achieved results to the interested public.
